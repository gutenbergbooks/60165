</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">1.</span> The legends contained in this book are those of the Navaho<a href="#not1" class="noteref">1</a> Indians, a tribe living in the southwestern portion of the United States; mostly
in the Territories of New Mexico and Arizona, but partly in the States of Colorado
and Utah. A definite reservation of over 12,000 square miles has been set apart for
them; but in every direction, beyond the borders of this reservation, isolated families
and small bands may be found dwelling, either temporarily or permanently, in localities
where there are springs, streams, pools, or artificial reservoirs of water. Some have
taken up homesteads&#x2014;or have otherwise acquired a legal title to lands beyond the borders
of the reservation; others are merely squatters. A brief description of these Indians&#x2014;their
arts, religion, ceremonies, etc.&#x2014;is included in this introduction, in the belief that,
if the reader possesses some knowledge of the Navaho before he begins to read the
tales, he may have a better understanding of the latter. But much more information,
of interest to the ethnographer, will be found in notes. Some items in the introduction
could not properly have appeared in the notes, as there was nothing in the tales to
suggest them. Other items might perhaps as well have been transferred to the notes;
the decision to put them in the introduction was often arbitrary.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">2.</span> <i>Title of Book.</i>&#x2014;In selecting a title for this book, the word Legends was chosen, rather than Myths,
for the reason that the tales contained herein, though mostly mythical, are not altogether
such. In the Origin Legend, the last chapter, &#x201c;The Growth of the Navaho Nation,&#x201d; is
in part traditional or historical, and it is even approximately correct in many of
its dates, as has been shown by Frederick Webb Hodge in his paper on the &#x201c;Early Navaho
and Apache.&#x201d;<a href="#not301" class="noteref">301</a>

<h3 class="main">HOME OF THE NAVAHOES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">3.</span> The land which the Navahoes occupy is arid, though not an absolute desert. The precipitation
at an altitude of 7,000 feet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>amounts on an average to only 14.10 inches during the year (at lower altitudes it
is less, at higher altitudes greater), and this is generally confined to two short
seasons of moisture separated from one another by months of absolute drought, which,
except in specially favored localities, would destroy any of our ordinary field-crops.
But there are small spots, far apart, where irrigation can be practised, and there
are other places, apparently deserts, which no white man would think of cultivating,
but where Indians raise meagre crops of corn, squashes, and melons.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">4.</span> <i>Soil.</i>&#x2014;He who stands on the brow of the mesa at the Indian pueblo of Walpi, in Arizona,
may unravel one secret of Indian agriculture in the arid region, and learn why ancient
ruins may be found in the most desolate parts. Six hundred feet below him stretches
a sandy plain which at most seasons of the year seems almost an absolute desert; yet
in summer it is green with rows of dwarf corn. Little rain falls on it and there is
no irrigation; yet the corn grows and furnishes a return which repays an Indian, at
least, for his labor. Through the plain runs a gully which at certain seasons drains
the water from a high table-land beyond. The water does not all flow off, but in part
settles under the sandy surface, and keeps the subsoil moist throughout the year.
By planting deep, the Indian farmers reach this moist subsoil, and place their seeds
where the long drought cannot destroy them. On the side of the mesa, peach-trees flourish,
with hidden moisture that comes out between the rocky strata at the mesa&#x2019;s edge. Localities
similar to those described are found in the Navaho land, and similarly used by the
Navaho for farms and peach orchards. The myths make frequent allusions to such farms
or gardens.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">5.</span> A few fields have recently been made by white men in the high meadows of the Zuñi
Mountains at altitudes above 8,000 feet, where potatoes, oats, barley, and garden
vegetables are raised without irrigation; but farming at such altitudes was never
tried by the Navahoes, and they knew nothing of cultivating the crops named above.
Beside their aboriginal crops, they have for a long time raised a little wheat. Potatoes
grow wild in the Navaho country.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">6.</span> <i>Mines.</i>&#x2014;Fortunately for the Navahoes, no mines of precious metals have yet been discovered
on their reservation; although for years past rumors of such discoveries have from
time to time been circulated, and unwelcome prospectors have frequently invaded their
territory. For many years previous to 1892 the principal attraction lay in the Carrizo
Mountains.<a href="#not2" class="noteref">2</a> A legend of a mine called the Lost Adam, and of miners murdered in these mountains,
had circulated long through Colorado mining camps. Troubles between intruders and
Indians became so frequent and threatening in this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>region that General McCook, then commanding the Department of Arizona, which included
the Navaho reservation, determined to make an expedition and settle, if possible,
the question of the existence of valuable mines in the Carrizo Mountains. A commission,
consisting of Gen. A. McD. McCook, U.S.A., ex-Gov. John L. Barstow of Vermont, and
Prof. J.&nbsp;G. Allyn of New Mexico, was appointed. The commission entered the mountains
with a mounted escort in May, 1892, and invited prospectors who had previously visited
the region to come and show where the mineral lay. They came, and then it appeared
they had staked off various claims and given them felicitous names such as the western
miners know how to coin,&#x2014;the &#x201c;Lucky Bill,&#x201d; the &#x201c;Boggy Snoggy,&#x201d; etc. Specimen ores
were collected from every point where they were seen, and submitted to careful expert
examination; but all proved worthless. Some fine gold has been found in the sands
of the San Juan River,<a href="#not3" class="noteref">3</a> within the Navaho reservation; but it has not been found profitable to work for it.

from 4,000 feet, or less, in the valley of the Colorado, to over 11,000 feet in the
high peaks of Ts&#x12d;snad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni,<a href="#not52" class="noteref">52</a> San Mateo,<a href="#not54" class="noteref">54</a> San Francisco,<a href="#not56" class="noteref">56</a> and the San Juan<a href="#not58" class="noteref">58</a> range, which traditionally border their land. In the central and more thickly inhabited
portion the highest eminence is in the Tuincha Mountains, 9,575 feet. The average
altitude is about 6,000 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>feet. The country consists mostly of great plains and of plateaux or mesas. While
the lower levels, except in the bottom-lands of the constantly flowing rivers, are
destitute of trees, the mesas, at altitudes of from 6,000 to 7,000 feet, are well
covered with low forests of piñon (<i lang="la">Pinus edulis</i>), red cedar (<i lang="la">Juniperus virginianus</i>) and juniper (<i lang="la">Juniperus occidentalis</i>). At altitudes of 7,000 feet white pine (<i lang="la">Pinus ponderosa</i>) is sparingly found; but at altitudes of 8,000 feet or more it grows abundantly and
attains a good size. Spruce (<i lang="la">Pseudotsuga taxifolia</i>) is found in shaded valleys, and on northern hill-slopes above 7,000 feet, but it
does not form an important part of the forest. It is an essential element in certain
rites. Cottonwood (<i lang="la">Populus monolifera</i> and <i lang="la">P. wislizenii</i>), aspen (<i lang="la">Populus tremuloides</i>), oak (<i lang="la">Quercus gambellii</i>), oak-bark juniper (<i lang="la">Juniperus pachyphl&#x153;a</i>), and other trees grow less abundantly.

that they do not do so to any great extent. Their crops furnish but a small part of
their subsistence. But their sterile country is fairly well adapted to the raising
of sheep and goats. These form their chief food supply, and the former their principal
source of wealth. With the money received for their wool they purchase flour and other
provisions from the white traders, as well as various articles of luxury and utility.
They possess many ponies and ride a great deal. They raise a few neat cattle.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">9.</span> As domesticated sheep and goats were unknown in America previous to the discovery
by Columbus, and were unknown in New Mexico previous to the expedition of Coronado
in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1540, it follows that the Navahoes have not been shepherds for many centuries. It
would appear from their legends that it is not many years since they have become a
prosperous and wealthy people (and such they now are, for savages); that in old days
they were even poor hunters; and that they lived largely on the seeds of wild plants
and on small animals that they caught in fall-traps. How meagrely they were dressed
and equipped the legends also tell us. (See <a href="#par382">pars. 382</a>, <a href="#par384">384</a>, <a href="#par391">391</a>.)

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">10.</span> No exact census of the tribe has ever been taken, and it would not now be an easy
task to take one, because the Navahoes are scattered so widely and over such a wild
and rugged territory. Their low huts, built in tangled cedar-woods or in regions of
scattered rocks, are often so obscurely hidden that one may ride through a cluster
of a dozen inhabited houses thinking there is not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>an Indian within ten miles of him. When the Navahoes were held in captivity at Fort
Sumner, New Mexico, from 1863 to 1867, they depended for subsistence mostly on rations
supplied by the United States, and then these captives, at least, could be accurately
counted. There were in 1867 7,300 in captivity.<a href="#not298" class="noteref">298</a> Owing to desertions on the one hand, and additional surrenders on the other, the
numbers varied from time to time.

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">11.</span> But while the majority of the tribe were prisoners of war, it is well known that
all were not captured during General Carson&#x2019;s invasion in 1863, but that many still
roamed at large while their brethren were prisoners. The count of the prisoners, therefore,
does not show the strength of the tribe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>

</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">12.</span> Perhaps the most accurate census ever taken was that of 1869. &#x201c;In November of 1869
a count was made of the tribe, in order to distribute among them 30,000 head of sheep
and 2,000 goats. Due notice was given months before, and the tribe was present. The
Indians were all put in a large corral, and counted as they went in. A few herders,
holding the small herds that they had then bunched on the surrounding hills, were
not in the corral. The result of this count showed that there were less than 9,000
Navahoes all told, making a fair allowance for all who had failed to come in. At that
time everything favored getting a full count; rations were issued to them every four
days; they had but little stock, and, in addition to the issue of the sheep and goats,
there were also two years&#x2019; annuities to be given out. The season of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>year was favorable, the weather fine, and they were all anxious to get the sheep and
goats and annuities.&#x201d;<a href="#not268" class="noteref">268</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">13.</span> In 1890 a count of these Indians was made as a part of the Eleventh Census of the
United States.<a href="#not297" class="noteref">297</a> Before the count was begun, the writer was informed by one of the enumerators that
the plan to be employed was this: The Navaho country was to be divided into a number
of districts, and a special enumerator was to be sent to each district at the same
time to visit each hut and take the number of each family. Whether this method was
carried out, the report of the Eleventh Census does not tell us. But this plan, while
probably the best that could be employed at the time with the means allotted, was
very imperfect and admitted of numerous sources of error, of which two may be specified.
Many huts might easily be passed unnoticed, for reasons already given, and this would
make the enumeration too low. Many families might easily have been counted in more
than one district, for the Navaho frequently shifts his abode, and this would make
the count too high. The result of this enumeration was to give the tribe a population
of 17,204 for that year. White men, living in the Navaho country at the time, generally
considered the estimate excessive. If the count of 1869 be approximately correct,
that of 1890 is probably not. It is not reasonable to suppose that by natural increase
alone&#x2014;and no other source of increment is known&#x2014;the tribe should have nearly doubled
in twenty-one years. It would require birth-rates much higher and death-rates much
lower than those commonly found in Indian tribes to double the population in that
time. The Indian mother is not prolific.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">14.</span> The Navahoes say that during their captivity they had much sickness and diminished
in numbers; but nothing has been found in official reports to corroborate such statements.
All who have any intimate knowledge of the Navahoes agree that they have increased
rapidly since they were restored to their ancient homes in 1869. During nearly fifteen
years that the author has had opportunity to observe them, he has noticed no marked
signs of physical degeneration among them. Their general health and their power of
resisting disease appeared about as good in 1894 as in 1880. Consumption and scrofula,
those greatest enemies of our reservation Indians, have not yet begun to trouble the
Navahoes. The change from the rude hut to the close stone house, which is rapidly
going on among this people, is likely to affect their health in the future, and probably
not for the better. Fortunately for them they have little fancy for stoves, but prefer
open fireplaces such as the Pueblos and Mexicans use. In the year 1888, while the
writer was absent from New Mexico, they had an epidemic of throat disease, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>precise character of which has not been ascertained. They say that about 800 people
died that winter. During the winter of 1894&#x2013;95 they suffered from scarcity of food,&#x2014;an
unusual experience for them, and the government had to assist them. An increased mortality
ensued, which undoubtedly would have been much greater had it not been for the prompt
action of their agent, Maj. Constant Williams, U.S.A., in securing supplies for them.

language, of the Dèné or Athapascan stock, and such, probably, they are in the main.
But their Origin Legend represents them as a very mixed race, containing elements
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>of Zuñian and other Pueblo stocks, of Shoshonian and Yuman, and the appearance of
the people seems to corroborate the legend. There is no such thing as a general or
prevailing Navaho type. The people vary much in feature and stature. Every variety
of Indian face and form may be seen among them,&#x2014;tall men with aquiline noses and prominent
features, such as we find among the Crows and Dakotas; dwarfish men with subdued features,
such as we see among the Pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona, and every intermediate
variety.

are any seen that are dull and stupid. These characteristics are to be noted among
the women as well as among the men. The social position <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>of the Navaho women is one of great independence; much of the wealth of the nation
belongs to them; they are the managers of their own property, the owners of their
own children, and their freedom lends character to their physiognomies.

habits, though he was regarded as a sage counsellor till the time of his death, which
occurred in 1893. When he was gone, an old Indian, announcing his death to the writer,

He it was who communicated to the author version B<a href="#not306" class="noteref">306</a> of the Origin Legend. He practised a short medicine rite, was an adept in singing
sacred songs, and often led in song in the great rites. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>silver-work was in great demand, and he worked hard at his trade. In 1894 he accompanied
a circus through the Eastern States, with his workshop as a side-show; but the journey

<p class="first"><span class="parNum">18.</span> As a rule the crania of the Navahoes are brachycephalic, and very few are dolichocephalic.
The shortening seems to be due to a flattening in the occipital region (<a href="#fig08">fig. 8</a>). The author is of opinion that this is caused by the use of the baby-case, with
a hard, unyielding wooden back (<a href="#fig09">fig. 9</a>), in which the Navaho women carry their infants. This flattening of the Navaho occiput
has been the subject of some controversy. It is true that the cradle is padded to
a slight extent; but the padding consists of the bark of the cliff rose (<i lang="la">Cowania mexicana</i>), called by the Navaho awétsal, or baby-bed, which forms a rather rigid pillow. True,
again, when the baby is carried on the mother&#x2019;s back, its head often hangs forward
and does not come in contact with the back of the cradle or the pillow; but most of
the time the child lies on its back, and its tender occiput is subjected to deforming
pressure.

<p class="first"><span class="parNum">19.</span> The language of the Navaho undoubtedly belongs in the main to the Athapascan family.
Hubert Howe Bancroft, in his &#x201c;Native Races of the Pacific States&#x201d; (vol. iii. p. 583),<a href="#not292" class="noteref">292</a> tells us that the Athapascans or &#x201c;Tinneh&#x201d; are &#x201c;a people whose diffusion is only equalled
by that of the Aryan or Semitic nations of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>Old World. The dialects of the Tinneh language are by no means confined within the
limits of the hyperborean division. Stretching from the northern interior of Alaska
down into Sonora and Chihuahua, we have here a linguistic line of more than four thousand
miles in length, extending diagonally over forty-two degrees of latitude, like a great
tree whose trunk is the Rocky Mountain range, whose roots encompass the deserts of
Arizona and New Mexico, and whose branches touch the borders of Hudson Bay and of
the Arctic and Pacific Oceans.&#x201d; But the Origin Legend declares it is a mixed language
(<a href="#par395">par. 395</a>), and it is but reasonable to suppose that such a composite race cannot possess a
very pure language. The various accessions to the tribe from other stocks have probably
added many words of alien origin. What these additions are is not now known, and will
not be known until all the languages of the Southwest have been thoroughly studied.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="par20" class="first"><span class="parNum">20.</span> The habitations of the Navahoes are usually of a very simple character. The most
common form consists of a conical frame, made by setting up a number of sticks at
an angle of about forty-five degrees. An opening is left on one side of the cone to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>answer as a doorway. The frame is covered with weeds, bark, or grass, and earth, except
at the apex, where the smoke from the fire in the centre of the floor is allowed to
escape. In the doorway an old blanket hangs, like a curtain, in place of a door. But
the opening of the door is not a simple hiatus, as many descriptions would lead one
to suppose. A cross-piece, forming a lintel, connects the jambs at a convenient height,
and the triangular space between the lintel and the smoke-hole is filled in as shown
in <a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>. A picture in Schoolcraft&#x2019;s extensive work<a href="#not327" class="noteref">327</a> (vol. iii. plate 17) is intended to represent a Navaho lodge; but it appears to have
been drawn by Captain Eastman from an imperfect description. In this picture the doorway
is shown as extended up and continuous with the smoke-hole.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">21.</span> Some lodges are made of logs in a polygonal form, as shown in <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>. Again they are occasionally built partly of stone, as shown in <a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>. In cold weather a small storm-door or portico is often erected in front of the door
(<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>), and an outer and an inner curtain may be hung to more effectually keep out the
wind.

Here, in fair weather, the family <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>often cook and spend most of the day. Here, too, the women erect their looms and weave
or set out their metates and grind corn, and some even choose to sleep here. Such

<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a> represents a couple of summer houses in the Zuñi Mountains. A structure of this kind
is built in a few hours. A couple of forked sticks are set upright in the ground;
slanting poles are laid against this in the direction of the prevailing winds, so
as to form a windbreak, half wall and half roof, and this is covered with grass, weeds,
and earth. The ends may be similarly <span class="corr" id="xd29e1253" title="Source: inclosed">enclosed</span>, or may be merely covered in with evergreen branches. One side of the house is completely
open. In <a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a> a loom is shown set up for work in one of these rude structures, the aboriginal appearance
of which is somewhat marred by having a piece of old canvas lying on top.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">24.</span> <i>Medicine-lodges.</i>&#x2014;The medicine-lodges, when erected in regions where long poles may be cut, are usually

it a storm-door. It is sometimes sunk partly underground and is always thickly covered
with earth. Stones are heated in a fire outside and carried, with an extemporized
tongs of sticks, into the sudatory. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17">17</a>]</span><a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a> poorly represents one of these structures. When ceremonially used, the frame is constructed

<p id="par26"><span class="parNum">26.</span> <i>Modern Houses.</i>&#x2014;During the past ten years, a few of the more progressive Navahoes have built themselves
rectangular stone houses, with flat roofs, glazed windows, wooden doors, and regular
chimneys, such as their neighbors, the Mexicans and Pueblo Indians, build. They have
had before them, for centuries, examples of such houses, and they are an imitative
and docile people. The reason they have not copied at an earlier date is probably
a superstitious reason. They believe a house haunted or accursed in which a human
being dies.<a href="#not91" class="noteref">91</a> They abandon it, never enter it again, and usually destroy it. With such a superstition
prevailing, they hesitate to build permanent dwellings. Perhaps of late years the
superstition is becoming weakened, or they have found some mystic way of averting
the supposed evil.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">27.</span> The arts of the Navahoes are not numerous. They make a very rude and inartistic pottery,&#x2014;vastly
inferior to that of the neighboring Pueblo tribes,&#x2014;and they make but little of it.
Their bows and arrows are not equal to those of the northern Indians, and, since they
have both money and opportunity to purchase modern firearms, bows and arrows are falling
into disuse. They do not consider themselves very expert dressers of deerskin, and
purchase their best buckskins from other tribes. The women do very little embroidery,
either with beads or porcupine-quills, and this little is unskilfully done. The legends
indicate that in former days they stole or purchased embroideries from the Utes.

</p>
<p id="par28"><span class="parNum">28.</span> <i>Basketry.</i>&#x2014;They make excellent baskets, but very few of them, and have a very limited range
of forms and patterns. In developing their blanket-making to the highest point of
Indian art, the women of this tribe have neglected other labors. The much ruder but
allied Apaches, who know nothing of weaving woollen fabrics, make more baskets than
the Navahoes, and make them in much greater variety of form, color, and quality. The
Navahoes buy most of their baskets and wicker water-jars from other tribes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>They would possibly lose the art of basketry altogether if they did not require certain
kinds to be used in the rites, and only women of the tribe understand the special
requirements of the rites. <a href="#fig16">Figs. 16</a> and <a href="#fig17">17</a> show the patterns of baskets almost exclusively made. These are used in ceremonies,
and are called by the author sacred baskets. A further description of them is given
in a note.<a href="#not5" class="noteref">5</a>

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">29.</span> <i>Silver-work.</i>&#x2014;There are a few silversmiths in the tribe, whose work, considering the rudeness of
their tools and processes, is very artistic. It is much sought after by white people,
who admire its rude beauty. Probably the art of the smith has not existed long among
the Navahoes. In a treatise entitled &#x201c;Navajo Silversmiths,&#x201d;<a href="#not307" class="noteref">307</a> the author described the art as it existed in 1881; but the work has improved since
that time with the introduction of better tools. Then the smith built his forge on
the ground and squatted to do his work; now he builds it on an elevated frame (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>), and sits on a stool or chair to work. <a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a> represents silver ornaments made by Jake in 1881.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">30.</span> <i>Weaving.</i>&#x2014;It is in the art of weaving that the Navahoes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>excel all other Indians within the borders of the United States. In durability, fineness
of finish, beauty of design, and variety of pattern, the Navaho blanket has no equal
among the works of our aborigines. The author has written a treatise on &#x201c;Navajo Weavers,&#x201d;<a href="#not309" class="noteref">309</a> in which he describes their art as it existed some thirteen years ago. But since
that treatise was written the art has changed. It has improved in one respect: an
important new invention has been made or introduced,&#x2014;a way of weaving blankets with
different designs on opposite sides. It has deteriorated in another respect: fugitive
aniline dyes, purchased from the traders, have taken the place of the permanent native
dyes formerly used. In the finer blankets, yarn obtained from white traders has supplanted
the yarn laboriously twilled on the old distaff. Navaho blankets are represented in
figs. <a href="#fig01">1</a>, <a href="#fig02">2</a>, <a href="#fig05">5</a>, <a href="#fig06">6</a>, <a href="#fig07">7</a>, and <a href="#fig12">12</a>.

<p><span class="parNum">31.</span> The Navahoes weave diagonal cloth and diamond-shaped diagonals, and to do this a
change is made in the mechanism of their simple looms. They weave belts or sashes,
garters and saddle-girths, and these articles, too, require changes in the arrangement
of the looms and in the methods of weaving. <a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a> represents an ordinary loom, with one set of healds. <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a> represents a loom arranged for weaving diagonal cloth with two sets of healds. <a href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a> shows a woman wearing a belt of native manufacture.

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">32.</span> It is not only for gain that the Navaho woman weaves her blanket. Having worn it
for a time, until it has lost its novelty, she may sell it for a price that scarcely
pays her for the yarn. One who possesses large herds, and is wealthy for an Indian,
will weave as assiduously as her poorest neighbor. At best, the labor brings low wages.
The work is done, to no small extent, for artistic recreation, just as the females
of our own race embroider and do &#x201c;fancy work&#x201d; for mere pastime.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">33.</span> <i>Knitting.</i>&#x2014;They knit stockings with four needles, but these stockings are devoid of heels and
toes. As the needles now used are of wire and obtained from the whites, it might be
thought that the art of knitting was learned from our people; but knitted leggings,
made of human hair, and wooden knitting-needles, have been found in the Navaho land,
in cliff-dwellings which, there is reason to believe, were abandoned before the arrival
of the Spaniards.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">34.</span> It cannot be said of the Navaho men, as it is often said of the men of other Indian
tribes, that they are either too proud or too lazy to perform manual labor. They are,
and apparently always have been, willing to do any remunerative work. When the Atlantic
and Pacific Railroad was constructed near their reservation, in 1881, much of the
grading was done by Navaho laborers. The white men who worked with them, and who had
the strongest antipathy to Chinese laborers, said that they liked the Indians because
they were good comrades on the work and kept up prices. A stalwart man is not ashamed
to wash and iron clothes for wages, which he may want only to spend in gambling. They
have been employed at Fort Wingate to dig cellars and make adobes, and at the latter
work proved themselves more expert than the more experienced men of Zuñi.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">35.</span> Begging, which among other tribes is so often annoying to the white man, is little
practised by the Navahoes. The few who have ever begged from the author persuaded
themselves that they had some claim on him. On the whole, they are a self-supporting
people, and add to the wealth of the community at large. But little government aid
has been given them since they were released from captivity and supplied with stock
in return for that slaughtered by our troops when their land was invaded.

<h3 class="main">POETRY AND MUSIC.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">36.</span> For many years the most trusted account of the Navaho Indians of New Mexico and Arizona
was to be found in a letter written by Dr. Jonathan Letherman,<a href="#not303" class="noteref">303</a> of the army, and published in the Smithsonian report for 1855. Dr. Letherman had
lived three years at Fort Defiance, in the heart of the Navaho country, when he wrote
this letter, and he acknowledges his indebtedness, for assistance in preparing it,
to Major Kendrick, who long commanded Fort Defiance. Both the doctor and the major
were men of unusual ability. The former (having changed the spelling of his name to
Letterman) afterwards distinguished himself as medical director of the Army of the
Potomac, and the latter was, for many years, professor of chemistry at the National
Military Academy.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">37.</span> From this letter the following statement concerning the Navahoes is extracted: &#x201c;Of
their religion little or nothing is known, as, indeed, all inquiries tend to show
that they have none.&#x201d; &#x201c;The lack of tradition is a source of surprise. They have no
knowledge of their origin or of the history of the tribe.&#x201d; &#x201c;They have frequent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>gatherings for dancing.&#x201d; &#x201c;Their singing is but a succession of grunts, and is anything
but agreeable.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">38.</span> The evidence of these gentlemen, one would think, might be taken as conclusive. Yet,
fifteen years ago, when the author first found himself among the Navahoes, he was
not influenced in the least by the authority of this letter. Previous experience with
the Indians had taught him of how little value such negative evidence might be, and
he began at once to investigate the religion, traditions, and poetic literature, of
which, he was assured, the Navahoes were devoid.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure fig20width" id="fig20"><img src="images/fig20.jpg" alt="Fig. 20. Ordinary loom." width="602" height="426"><p class="figureHead"><span class="figNum">Fig. 20.</span> Ordinary loom.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">39.</span> He had not been many weeks in New Mexico when he discovered that the dances to which
Dr. Letherman refers were religious ceremonials, and later he found that these ceremonials
might vie in allegory, symbolism, and intricacy of ritual with the ceremonies of any
people, ancient or modern. He found, erelong, that these heathens, pronounced godless
and legendless, possessed lengthy myths and traditions&#x2014;so numerous that one can never
hope to collect them all, a pantheon as well stocked with gods and heroes as that
of the ancient Greeks, and prayers which, for length and vain repetition, might put
a Pharisee to the blush.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">40.</span> But what did the study of appalling &#x201c;succession of grunts&#x201d; reveal? It revealed that
besides improvised songs, in which the Navahoes are adepts, they have knowledge of
thousands of significant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>songs&#x2014;or poems, as they might be called&#x2014;which have been composed with care and handed
down, for centuries perhaps, from teacher to pupil, from father to son, as a precious
heritage, throughout the wide Navaho nation. They have songs of travelling, appropriate
to every stage of the journey, from the time the wanderer leaves his home until he
returns. They have farming songs, which refer to every stage of their simple agriculture,
from the first view of the planting ground in the spring to the &#x201c;harvest home.&#x201d; They
have building songs,<a href="#not6" class="noteref">6</a> which celebrate every act in the structure of the hut, from &#x201c;thinking about it&#x201d; to
moving into it and lighting the first fire. They have songs for hunting, for war,
for gambling, in short for every important occasion in life, from birth to death,
not to speak of prenatal and <i>post-mortem</i> songs. And these songs are composed according to established (often rigid) rules,
and abound in poetic figures of speech.
</p>
<p id="par41"><span class="parNum">41.</span> <i>Sacred Songs.</i>&#x2014;Perhaps the most interesting of their metrical compositions are those connected with
their sacred rites,&#x2014;their religious songs. These rites are very numerous, many of
them of nine days&#x2019; duration, and with each is associated a number of appropriate songs.
Sometimes, pertaining to a single rite, there are two hundred songs or more which
may not be sung at other rites.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">42.</span> The songs must be known to the priest of the rite and his assistants in a most exact
manner, for an error made in singing a song may be fatal to the efficacy of a ceremony.
In no case is an important mistake tolerated, and in some cases the error of a single
syllable works an irreparable injury. A noteworthy instance of this rule is a song
sung at the beginning of work on the last night of the great ceremony of the night
chant. The rite is one which may cost the patron from two hundred to three hundred
dollars. It has lasted eight days and nights, when four singers, after long and careful
instruction by the priest, come forth painted, adorned, and masked as gods to sing
this song of the atsá&#x2bb;<i>l</i>ei. Several hundred people&#x2014;many from the farthest confines of the Navaho land&#x2014;have
come to sit up all night and witness the public ceremonies. The song is long, and
is mostly made up of meaningless or obsolete expressions which convey no idea to the
mind of the singer, yet not a single vocable may be omitted, mispronounced, or misplaced.
A score or more of critics who know the song by heart are listening with strained
attention. If the slightest error is made it is at once proclaimed, the fruitless
ceremony terminates abruptly, and the disappointed multitude disperses.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">43.</span> The songs all contain significant words; but these, for poetic requirements, are
often greatly distorted, and the distortions must be kept in mind. In speaking thus,
scant justice is done to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>Navaho poets. Similar distortions found in an Aryan tongue with a written literature
are spoken of as figures of orthography and etymology, and, although there is yet
no standard of spelling for the Navaho language, we would perhaps do well to apply
the same terms in speaking of the Navaho compositions. The distortions are not always
left to the whim of the composer. They are made systematically, as a rule. If the
language were reduced to a standard spelling, we should find that the Navaho poets
have as many figures of these classes as the English poets have, and perhaps more.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">44.</span> Some of the words, too, are archaic,&#x2014;they mean nothing in modern Navaho; but the
priests assign traditional meanings to them, and this adds to the task of memorizing.
But, in addition to the significant words, there are (as instanced above) numerous
meaningless vocables in all songs, and these must be recited with a care at least
equal to that bestowed on the rest of the composition. These meaningless sounds are
commonly introduced in the preludes and refrains of the stanzas and in the verse endings,
but they may occur anywhere in the song.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure fig21width" id="fig21"><img src="images/fig21.jpg" alt="Fig. 21. Loom for weaving diagonal cloth." width="580" height="389"><p class="figureHead"><span class="figNum">Fig. 21.</span> Loom for weaving diagonal cloth.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">45.</span> The preludes and refrains here referred to are found, with rare exceptions, in every
stanza and in every song. Although they are all either totally meaningless or only
partly significant, they are the most characteristic parts of the poems, and the singer
cons the preludes over when he wishes to call to mind any particular composition,
just as we often remember a poem or song by means of the first line. They are rarely
or never quite alike in any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>two songs, and great ingenuity is often displayed in giving them variety.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">46.</span> There is yet another burden laid on the memory of the singer of sacred songs, and
this is the order of their arrangement. The songs of each ceremony are divided into
groups which must follow one another in an established order, and each song has, in
the group to which it belongs, a place that must not be changed under penalty of divine
displeasure. To sing, during the progress of a rite, the sixth Song of the Whirling
Sticks before the fifth song is sung, would be a sacrilege as great as to chant the
syllables óhohohó, in place of éhehehé. To remember this exact order of sequence in
a set of two hundred or three hundred songs is no easy task.<a href="#not322" class="noteref">322</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">47.</span> But it may be said: &#x201c;Perhaps things were different with the Navahoes in Dr. Letherman&#x2019;s
day. May they not have learned from other tribes, or have themselves invented all
this ceremony and song since he knew them?&#x201d; The reply to this is, that it is absurd
to suppose that such an elaborate system of rites and songs could have grown up among
an illiterate people in the twenty-five years that elapsed between Dr. Letherman&#x2019;s
departure from the Navaho country and the author&#x2019;s arrival there. Besides, the latter
obtained his information from men of advanced age&#x2014;from sixty to eighty years old&#x2014;who
practised these rites and sang these songs in their youth, and who in turn learned
them from men of a departed generation. The shamans who conduct these ceremonies,
tell these tales, and sing these songs are scattered widely over the Navaho country.
Men who are scarcely acquainted with one another, and who learned from different preceptors,
will sing the same sacred songs and to exactly the same tune. All the lore of the
Navaho priesthood was undoubtedly extant in Dr. Letherman&#x2019;s time and for ages before.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">48.</span> <i>Songless Women.</i>&#x2014;It is remarkable that, while the Navaho men are such fruitful composers of song and
such ardent singers, the women, as a rule, do not sing. Among the wild hunting tribes
of the North, as the author knew them thirty years ago, the women not only had songs
of their own, but they took part in the ceremonial songs of the men. The Pueblo Indian
women of New Mexico, neighbors of the Navahoes, have many fine songs, the song of
the corn-grinders, often heard in Zuñi, being especially wild and musical. But usually
the Navaho woman is songless. The writer tried a long time to find a woman who could
sing, and offered good pecuniary inducements before he got one. She came from a distance
of thirty miles. She knew no songs peculiar to her sex, but her father was a medicine-man,
who frequently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>repeated his songs at home in order to familiarize himself with them, and she gradually
picked up several of them. She sang in a musical soprano with much spirit, and was
one of the most pleasing singers heard in the tribe.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">49.</span> <i>Figures of Speech.</i>&#x2014;It is probable that all rhetorical figures of speech known to our poets may be found
in these simple compositions of the Navahoes. But in many cases the allusions are
to such recondite matters of symbolism, or incidents in their myths, that they could
be made plain, if at all, only by a tedious recital. Thus it would not be easy to
make clear in a few words why, when the goddess Estsánatlehi, in one of the songs
to her honor, is spoken of as climbing a wand of turquoise, we know the poet means
to say she is ascending San Mateo Mountain, in New Mexico, or why, when he speaks
of her as climbing a wand of haliotis shell, he is endeavoring to tell us that she
is ascending the peak of San Francisco in Arizona. Yet we may gain some idea of the
meaning by referring to the myth (<a href="#par193">par. 193</a>).
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">50.</span> But some of the metaphors and similes are not so hard to understand. Here is a translation
of the Dove Song, one of the gambling songs sung in the game of k&#x115;s&#x12d;t<i>s</i>é:&#x2014;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">Here <i>Wo<i>s</i> Wo<i>s</i></i> (W&#x14d;sh W&#x14d;sh) is an onomatope for the dove, equivalent to our &#x201c;coo coo&#x201d;; but it is
used as a noun. Glossy Locks and Red Moccasin are figurative expressions for the dove,
of obvious significance. Metaphor and synecdoche are here combined.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">51.</span> Antithesis is not an uncommon figure with the Navaho poet. Here is an instance of
it in a song belonging to the mountain chant, one of the great nine-day ceremonies
of the shamans:&#x2014;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">

<p><span class="parNum">53.</span> It will be seen from the instances given that they understand the value of repetition

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">54.</span> <i>Rhyme.</i>&#x2014;They are not ignorant of the value of rhyme in poetry, but they more often produce
this by the repetition of significant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>or meaningless syllables than by selecting different words with similar endings. Still
we often find this, the more difficult means, resorted to as in the above song of
the bluebird.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">55.</span> <i>Music.</i>&#x2014;To the casual listener it may appear that there is much sameness in the music of
their songs; but a more careful study will reveal the fact that the variety is great.
It is remarkable how, with such rude instruments (an inverted basket for a drum, and
a gourd rattle) to accompany them, they succeed, in a series of two hundred or more
songs, in producing so many musical changes. In their sacred songs of sequence, where
four or more songs of similar import follow one another, as is often the case, the
music may be nearly alike (but never quite alike) in all; but when the theme of the
poetry changes, the music also takes a decided change.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">56.</span> For further information on the subject of music the reader is referred to <a href="#not272">note 272</a>, which contains remarks by Prof. John Comfort Fillmore, formerly of Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
but now of Claremont, California. Over two years ago the writer sent a number of phonographic
records of Navaho songs to Professor Fillmore, who has diligently studied them and
has written many of them in musical notation. Some of the musical scores are appended
to the note.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">57.</span> <i>Gentes.</i>&#x2014;The version of the Origin Legend by Tall Chanter, here given, accounts for only thirty-eight
gentes among the Navahoes; but this informant was able to name, in all, forty-three
gentes, two of which, he said, were extinct. Lists of the Navaho gentes have been
obtained from various sources, and no single authority has been found to give a greater
number than this. But no two lists are quite alike; they differ with regard to small
or extinct gentes, and one list may supply a name which another has omitted. There
would be at least fifty-one gentes extant and extinct in the tribe if each name so
far obtained represented a different organization. But we find in the Legend instances
of a gens having two names (<a href="#par386">pars. 386</a>, <a href="#par405">405</a>, <a href="#par428">428</a>, <a href="#par445">445</a>).
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">58.</span> On the other hand, it is possible that none of the lists may be complete. Gentes
derived from women of alien races, added to the tribe since it has grown numerous
and widely scattered, may exist in one part of the Navaho country unknown to the best
informed persons in another part. Extinct gentes may be forgotten by one informant
and remembered by another.

<p><span class="parNum">61.</span> More than one translation of a gentile name has often been noted; but in the above
lists only one translation is given,&#x2014;that which the author regards with the most favor.
Often, too, different narrators account differently for the origin of the gentile
names. Some of the translations are very liberal, and others, again, very brief; but
in the paragraphs and notes to which the reader is referred he will find fuller explanations.
The Navahoes sometimes, but not invariably, add (as shown in the above lists) a suffix
(<span class="corr" id="xd29e2546" title="Source: d&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;"><i>d</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb;</span>, ni, <i>or</i> i), signifying people; but in the above translations, to simplify the study, the
word &#x201c;people&#x201d; is omitted.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">62.</span> There are reasons, which the author has set forth in a previous essay<a href="#not318" class="noteref">318</a> and will not now repeat, for believing that most of the Navaho gentes were originally
local exogamous groups, and not true gentes according to Morgan&#x2019;s definition.<a href="#not325" class="noteref">325</a> There is little doubt that, in the majority of cases if not in all, the names of
Navaho gentes, which are not the names of tribes, are simply designations of localities,
even where the Legend states to the contrary; as, for instance, when it tells us that
certain gentes of the Western immigrants were named from words that women uttered
when they first tasted of the magic fountains (<a href="#par427">pars. 427</a>, <a href="#par429">429</a>, <a href="#par430">430</a>).
</p>
<p id="par63"><span class="parNum">63.</span> On the other hand, there are passages in the Legend which indicate that a few of
the Navaho gentes were once totemic, although no evidence of clan totems is known
to exist among the Navahoes at the present time, and it is not improbable that a few
of the gentile names may be of totemic origin, although they are now accounted for
in other ways in the Origin Legend. The passage (<a href="#par419">par. 419</a>) which tells us that Estsánatlehi gave certain pets to the wanderers from the West,
and that these pets accompanied the people on their journey, refers in all probability
to the former use of totemic clan symbols, and possibly to a custom of keeping live
totemic animals in captivity,&#x2014;a custom prevalent among the ancient Mexicans and the
modern Pueblos, though not among the modern Navahoes. Other indications of a former
totemism may be found in the story of the Deer Spring People (<a href="#par442">par. 442</a>, <a href="#not195">note 195</a>; see, also, <a href="#not173">note 173</a>).
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">64.</span> In reading the fourth chapter of the Origin Legend&#x2014;&#x201c;Growth of the Navaho Nation&#x201d;&#x2014;one
is impressed with the different degrees of willingness, on both sides, with which
new gentes are adopted into the nation. In some instances two parties, meeting for
the first time, embrace one another and become friends at once (<a href="#par382">par. 382</a>). The clans from the Pacific coast&#x2014;the Western immigrants, as they are here called&#x2014;learn
of the existence of kindred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>tribes far to the east, take a long and dangerous journey to join them, and, when
their march is done, they are received by the Navahoes at once as brethren. On the
other hand, the legend tells us of bands that camp long in the neighborhood of the
Navahoes before they become incorporated with the latter (<a href="#par394">par. 394</a>); of other clans descended from captives (<a href="#par406">pars. 406</a>, <a href="#par454">454</a>, <a href="#par455">455</a>); and of others that seek refuge among the Navahoes only to escape starvation or
persecution at home (<a href="#par403">pars. 403</a>, <a href="#par452">452</a>). On the basis of their mode of adoption, the clans may be divided into the ready
and the reluctant. The cause of this is probably one of language. Bands which we know
to have been allied in language to the Navahoes&#x2014;such as those derived from the Apaches&#x2014;will
be found among the ready; while bands which we know to have spoken languages very
different to the Navaho&#x2014;such as those derived from the Utes, from Zuñi, and Jemez&#x2014;will
be found among the reluctant. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the same rule
applies to clans of whose original language we know nothing.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">65.</span> <i>Phratries.</i>&#x2014;The gentes of the Navahoes are divided into a number of groups, each of which may
be called a phratry. Authorities in the tribe differ as to the number of the phratries,
and as to the gentes that compose them. Some make but eight phratries. Captain Bourke<a href="#not294" class="noteref">294</a> has obtained a list of eleven, with three independent gentes. Some of the Navahoes
say there are twelve phratries, and suggest that they have some relation to the twelve
tribes who dwelt in the first world. But the Navaho phratry seems not to be a homogeneous
organization. A case is mentioned in the Legend where a gens has changed its phratral
affinities (<a href="#par451">par. 451</a>). Inquiry, too, has revealed that there are sub-groups. There may be closer bonds
of alliance among some gentes in a group than there are among others in the same group.
Authorities, then, may differ without invalidating each other&#x2019;s testimony.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">66.</span> These groups are indicated in the Legend when it says that one gens has become closely
related or affiliated with another (<a href="#par385">pars. 385</a>, <a href="#par399">399</a>, <a href="#par403">403</a> <i>et al.</i>), or when it says that two gentes cannot intermarry (<a href="#par393">pars. 393</a>, <a href="#par401">401</a>, <a href="#par406">406</a>). If the Navahoes have a term equivalent to &#x201c;phratry,&#x201d; it has not been discovered.
They have no special names for the different phratries; they often, but not always,
speak of a phratry by the name of the most important gens in it.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">67.</span> If the Legend is to be taken as evidence, phratries have developed among the Navahoes
both by segmentation of gentes and by the addition of new gentes from without; not
by either method exclusively. But legendary evidence is not needed to show that gentes
which bear to-day the names of alien tribes have been additions to the phratry.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">68.</span> <i>Forbidden Degrees of Kindred.</i>&#x2014;A Navaho belongs to the gens of his mother and takes the name of that gens. Cases
have been noted where a Navaho has been known by his gentile name and not by any other.
No man may marry one of his own gens; neither may he marry one of his own phratry,
though some exceptions seem to be made in the latter case where the limits of the
phratry are not well defined. Where this descent in the female line exists among other
tribes, it is held by some ethnographers that the man does not regard his father or
his father&#x2019;s people as his relations, and may contract a marriage with a woman of
his father&#x2019;s gens. Such is certainly not the case among the Navahoes. The gens and
the phratry of the father are as much forbidden kindred as those of the mother.

<h3 class="main">RELIGION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">69.</span> <i>Sources of Information.</i>&#x2014;That the Navahoes have a religion&#x2014;an elaborate pagan cult&#x2014;has already been intimated.
There is little to be gained by asking a Navaho direct questions about this. Learned
controversialists and theologians, capable of analyzing and discussing their faith,
have not arisen among them, or, if they have, they cannot easily communicate their
philosophy to us. But the civilized scholar has abundant material from which to study
their religion, and he must do the analyzing himself. In the great dry-paintings shown
on the floors of the medicine-lodges, during their long ceremonies, may be seen pictures
of many of the gods, with their hieratic belongings. In the ceremonies, or so-called
dances, men are masked to represent gods. In the myths the acts and deeds of the divine
ones are described, and we learn their thoughts and feelings,&#x2014;kind, like Indians,
to their kindred; usually cruel, yet often merciful and magnanimous, to their foes.
In the countless songs of the rites may be found the poetic side of the divine characters,
and in the long prayers we may learn their potency, and discover how man hopes to
commune with them and gain their favor.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">70.</span> <i>No Supreme God.</i>&#x2014;The religion of this people reflects their social condition. Their government is
democratic. There is no highest chief of the tribe, and all their chiefs are men of
temporary and ill-defined authority, whose power depends largely on their personal
influence, their oratory, and their reputation for wisdom. It is difficult for such
a people to conceive of a Supreme God. Their gods, like their men, stand much on a
level of equality.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">71.</span> <i>Sun God.</i>&#x2014;In the version of the Origin Legend here given, the Sun God would seem to have some
precedence over the others, but in the beginning he was only one of the people; he
never figures conspicuously as a Creator, and is far from omnipotent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>Other gods, less potent or less respected, lived before the time of man, and were
powerful before the sun was made.
</p>
<p id="par72"><span class="parNum">72.</span> <i>Creation.</i>&#x2014;The Legend begins with an already created world; there is no original creation and
no Creator of all. If the Navahoes have a story of the beginning of all things, the
author has not learned it. To a god called Békot<i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>d</i>i<a href="#not78" class="noteref">78</a> is given the credit of having made all animals whose creation is not otherwise accounted
for in the myths, especially domestic animals. Some of the Indians who have heard
vaguely of our Creator are of the opinion that Békot<i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>d</i>i is the God of the Americans.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">73.</span> <i>Estsánatlehi.</i>&#x2014;But it is generally acknowledged by the Navahoes that their most revered deity is
Estsánatlehi,<a href="#not95" class="noteref">95</a> the Woman Who Changes (or rejuvenates herself). Much is said of her in the legends,
but something more is to be obtained by conversation with the shamans. The name Estsánatlehi
is derived by syncopation from estsán, woman, and natéhi, to change or transform.
She is so called because, it is supposed, she never remains in one condition, but
that she grows to be an old woman, and in the course of time becomes a young girl
again, and so passes through an endless course of lives, changing but never dying.
It is probable that she is an apotheosis of Nature, or of the changing year.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">74.</span> The deity of fruitful Nature is properly a female and a beneficent goddess. She is
properly, too, as the legends tell us, the wife of the Sun, to whom Nature owes her
fertility. Her home is said to be in the west, probably for the reason that in the
Navaho country, which lies mostly on the Pacific slope, the rain comes usually from
the west, and from that direction, too, come the thawing breezes in the spring.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">75.</span> <i>Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán.</i>&#x2014;A divinity called Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán,<a href="#not96" class="noteref">96</a> or White Shell Woman, created (or found, as some versions say) at the same time as
Estsánatlehi, is called the younger sister of the latter. The two goddesses are associated
in the myths, but White Shell Woman always acts the subordinate part, and to-day is
honored with a less degree of worship than her sister. Estsánatlehi, made of an earthly
jewel, turquoise, is related to the land. Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán, made of white shell from the ocean, is related to the waters.
</p>
<p id="par76"><span class="parNum">76.</span> <i>War Gods.</i>&#x2014;Next in importance to Estsánatlehi, the sacred brethren, Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni (or Nagénezga&#x323;ni)
and <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni,<a href="#not127" class="noteref">127</a> seem to stand. The writer designates these as the War Gods, but the Navahoes do not
call them thus. According to the version of the Origin Legend here given, one of these
was the child of Estsánatlehi and the Sun; the other the child of Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán and the Water, and this is the version most consistent in all respects.
Other versions make both the brothers children of Estsánatlehi. Some say they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>were born twins. Accepting any of these versions, they would properly be called brothers,
according to the Indian system of relationship, and such they are called in the legends.
Their chief mission was to destroy the alien gods; but they still help the warriors
in battle, and aid the sick who suffer from witchcraft. The longest chapter in the
Origin Legend is devoted to recounting their genesis and history. In reading the chapter,
it will be apparent to the comparative mythologist that these characters have their
counterparts, which need not now be mentioned, in the myths of many races in both
hemispheres. From their mythic associations it would appear that Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni is a
god of light, with its associated heat, while <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni is a god of darkness, with its associated moisture; yet, apparently in contradiction
to this, the representative of the former is painted black and wears a black mask
in the ceremonies (<a href="#plate4">plate IV.</a>), while the representative of the latter is painted red and wears a red mask (<a href="#plate7">plate VII.</a>).
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">77.</span> Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, whose name signifies Slayer of the Alien Gods,<a href="#not127" class="noteref">127</a> is spoken of as the elder brother in the legends and always plays the more important
part. <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni, or Child of the Water,<a href="#not127" class="noteref">127</a> is called the younger brother and always appears as a subordinate character. In the
ceremonies, the masquerader who personates Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni always walks in front, while
he who personates <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni comes behind. The two gods are always associated in prayer and sacrifice, but
here, again, Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni takes precedence. In all the sacred songs where they are
mentioned, the superiority of Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni is indicated. Antithesis, as has been said,
is a favorite figure with the Navaho poets, and they often employ it when speaking
of these gods. The &#x201c;Song of the Approach&#x201d; of the War Gods in the ceremony of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> will serve, as well as many other compositions, to show how they treat this subject.

</p>
<p id="par78"><span class="parNum">78.</span> <i>Yéi.</i>&#x2014;There are a number of divinities in the Navaho pantheon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>known as yéi (in compound words often pronounced ye or ge), which is translated &#x201c;god&#x201d;
or &#x201c;genius.&#x201d; What distinction exists between the yéi and other gods is not easy to
determine definitely. The Zuñians have a class of gods called by the same name, or,
more correctly, &#x201c;yéyi,&#x201d; as Mr. Cushing pronounces it. Certain chiefs or important
personages among these gods are called by names which begin with the syllables <i>h</i>ast<i>s</i>é&#x2014;as <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i<a href="#not73" class="noteref">73</a> (Talking God), <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an<a href="#not74" class="noteref">74</a> (House God). It is believed that this, if spelled etymologically, would appear as
<i>h</i>astyé, but it is not so pronounced, <i>H</i>ast is a prefix denoting age, especially venerable age. We have it in the word <i>h</i>as<i>t</i>í<i>n</i>, which means a worthy or respected old man. <i>H</i>astyé would mean a venerable yéi or god. The yéi seem to be deities of minor importance
to those previously mentioned and to be more numerous. Thus, while there is but one
Estsánatlehi, but one Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, and but one <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni there are several <span class="corr" id="xd29e2875" title="Source: Hastséhogan"><i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an</span> and several <span class="corr" id="xd29e2894" title="Source: Hastséyalti"><i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i</span>, who are chiefs of the yéi. The yéi are supposed to abide in certain localities,
and in prayers in their honor the home is mentioned of the yéi to whom appeal is specially
made. A place called Tsé&#x2bb;nat<i>s</i>i, or Red Horizontal Rock, somewhere north of the San Juan River, Tse&#x2bb;gíhi, another
place north of the San Juan, and the White House (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>), in the Chelly Canyon, are important homes of the yéi.<a href="#not265" class="noteref">265</a> Each of the sacred mountains has its group of yéi. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>the myths of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, more than a score of places are named where yéi dwell. There are some reasons for
believing that the cult of the yéi is derived from the Cliff-dwellers, or from the
Pueblos; but there are arguments, too, against this theory. The subject will not be
further considered here. The yéi are supposed to be married and have families. The
males are called yébaka; the females, yébaad.<a href="#not200" class="noteref">200</a> <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni,<a href="#not212" class="noteref">212</a> the god of fire, and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éol<i>t</i>oi,<a href="#not206" class="noteref">206</a> the divine huntress, or goddess of the chase, belong, as their names indicate, to
the yéi; while Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i,<a href="#not207" class="noteref">207</a> the harvest god, and <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li<a href="#not98" class="noteref">98</a> Water Sprinkler, are associated with them in the legends.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">79.</span> <i>D</i>&#x12d;gíni.&#x2014;<i>D</i>&#x12d;g&#x12d;&#x2032;n means sacred, divine, mysterious, or holy. It is not quite synonymous with the
Dakota wakán or the Hidatsa hopá. It is not applied to the treatment of disease; it
is not applied in a general way to religious ceremonial; it has not been heard applied
to the anáye, or other things of evil: for this reason it is often translated &#x201c;holy.&#x201d;
<i>D</i>&#x12d;gíni, derived from <i>d</i>&#x12d;g&#x12d;&#x2032;n, means holy people, gods, divinities. It is a name applied to the highest and
lowest divinities, including the yéi (see notes <a href="#not92">92</a> and <a href="#not93">93</a>).
</p>
<p id="par80"><span class="parNum">80.</span> <i>Alien Gods.</i>&#x2014;Such are the gods that are friendly to the human race; but man has his enemies, too,
among the mysterious powers. Chief among the latter are the anáye,<a href="#not7" class="noteref">7</a> the alien gods or inimical genii. These, being analogous to the giants and ogres
of European folk-lore, are sometimes called giants in this work. They are usually
represented as creatures of great size. Many of them are described in the Origin Legend.
The worst have been slain, as the story relates; but others, being not unmixed evils,
still remain to torment man. The legend, in accounting for their continued existence,
shows the philosophic endeavor of our race to reconcile itself to the unwelcome inevitable.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">81.</span> <i>Water God.</i>&#x2014;The position of Tiéholtsodi,<a href="#not8" class="noteref">8</a> the water monster, is one of transferred allegiance. He was once the enemy of our
race, but now has become friendly to it in certain ways, though it is probable that
he is still thought to be responsible for cases of drowning. Other gods, who were
once inimical to man but are now his friends, are mentioned in the legends (<a href="#par354">par. 354</a>). But we are not without evidence that the Navaho fears to offend his most beneficent
gods lest the latter may directly punish him, or at least withhold their succor in
his hour of need.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">82.</span> <i>Devils.</i>&#x2014;Besides the alien gods, there are evil spirits haunting the earth which men dread;
these are the t<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ndi, whose name cannot be better translated than by calling them devils. The Navahoes
frequently speak of the t<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ndi (Englished, chindee), and they often use the term as an angry exclamation, just
as the profane among ourselves say, &#x201c;Oh the Devil!&#x201d; or &#x201c;You devil!&#x201d; (see pars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38">38</a>]</span><a href="#par257">257</a>, <a href="#par260">260</a>), yet they dislike to discuss its character or appearance. They believe there is
a devil associated with every corpse, and that it has something of the appearance
of a partly decayed corpse. The spirit of the dead man goes to the lower world, which
was the former home of the race, yet a demon remains with the dead body. Other Indians
believe in a similar corpse spirit, yet the author has never known any who have such
dread as the Navahoes of human mortuary remains. (See <a href="#par188">par. 188</a> and <a href="#not91">note 91</a>.)
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">83.</span> <i>Zoölatry.</i>&#x2014;The legend tells us that there is a First Man and a First Woman (see <a href="#par160">pars. 160</a>&#x2013;<a href="#par165">165</a>), who came into being in the fourth world as the result of a special act of creation:
but they have not died like Adam and Eve; they still live in some form; they are potent;
they are immortal; they are divine. But it is not man only that has his divine ancestral
prototype: every animal on the face of the earth has its also, and many, if not all,
of these are objects of worship. A share of reverence, too, in some cases, as in that
of the bear, is bestowed on their mortal descendants. In the rite of the mountain
chant<a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a> many of the sacrifices are sacred to the animals of the mountains. In short, zoölatry
is an important element in Navaho worship.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">84.</span> <i>Local Gods.</i>&#x2014;Some of the gods mentioned are also local divinities; thus the War Gods are local
divinities at <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;&#x2032;tli (<a href="#par374">par. 374</a>), and the yéi are local divinities at Tsé&#x2bb;nat<i>s</i>i. But, in addition to these, there are other gods of places so numerous that a complete
list of them will probably never be obtained. In the Origin Legend it is shown that
each of the sacred mountains of the Navaho land (seven in number according to Tall
Chanter) has its divine pair of indwelling guardians, and these seem to receive more
honor than any others which are gods of places only; but the genii of other mountains
and of different rocks and canyons have their prayers and sacrifices in some of the
rites.

</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">85.</span> Fanciful legends of places are common in all lands and among all races, but no people
are more ingenious in composing such tales than our American Indians. The Navaho has
unusual sources of inspiration in this direction, and he fails not to profit by them.
His land abounds in wonderful geologic formations, in rocks strangely sculptured by
rain and by Nature&#x2019;s sand-blast, in vast volcanic peaks and fields of lava; and it
abounds also, as might be expected, in myths accounting for these features, and in
the genii which belong to the myths. A few of these myths are incorporated in the
tales told in this work, but they are very few compared with the total of such legendary
lore.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">86<span class="corr" id="xd29e3071" title="Source: ,">.</span></span> The strength of their belief in these local divinities may be illustrated by the
following incident: The writer once made a journey, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>accompanied by two Navahoes, to T<i>s</i>ú<i>s</i>kai<a href="#not9" class="noteref">9</a> (Chusca Knoll), which is supposed to be the home of the T<i>s</i>iké <i>S</i>a<i>s</i> Nátlehi, or Maidens who Become Bears. When the party got to the top of the ridge
from which the knoll rises, and about three hundred yards from the base of the knoll,
the Indians refused to go farther, saying they feared the divine ones who dwelt in
the knoll. The writer proceeded alone, and had much difficulty in riding up the pathless
hill, among loose rocks and fallen trees. On the summit he found a little hollow among
the rocks full of sand, and, scraping into this, he discovered a number of hand-wrought
stone and shell beads, which had been put there as sacrifices. When he descended from
the knoll, he found the Indians awaiting him where he had left them, and all set out
together to retrace the rough mountain trail down to Red Lake. In a little while,
his horse becoming very lame, the writer was obliged to dismount. &#x201c;What has made your
horse lame?&#x201d; asked the Indians. &#x201c;He must have struck his leg against some of the fallen
trees when he was climbing the knoll,&#x201d; was the answer. &#x201c;Think not thus, foolish American,&#x201d;
they said. &#x201c;It was not the fallen trees that wounded your horse. The <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni of the mountain have stricken him because you went where you had no right to
go. You are lucky if nothing worse happens to you.&#x201d; Of course Indians had been up
to the top of the knoll, or the beads could not have been put there; but they went
only after preparatory prayer and only to deposit sacrifices.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">87.</span> <i>Demonolatry.</i>&#x2014;There are writers who say that the Indians &#x201c;worship the Devil&#x201d; and other malevolent
powers; but it is not only learned authors who speak thus. Jesus Alviso, a Mexican
captive reared among the Navahoes, said to the author in 1880: &#x201c;<span lang="es">Los Indios hacen figuras de todos sus diablos, <span class="corr" id="xd29e3100" title="Source: senor">señor</span></span>&#x201d; (&#x201c;The Indians make figures of all their devils, sir<span class="corr" id="xd29e3103" title="Source: ),&#x201d;">&#x201d;),</span> and it was this hint which led to the discovery of their dry-paintings. He called
them devils; in this work they are called gods. Perhaps other tribes worship personifications
of evil, but certainly the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>Navahoes do not. The gods who are supposed to love and help men the most receive the
greatest honor. The evil spirits are not worshipped except, rumor says, by the witches.
It would appear, moreover, from the Origin Legend, that the worst of evil powers&#x2014;the
alien gods&#x2014;were long ago destroyed, and that only demons of minor influence remain.
The chief of witches, Estsán Na<i>t</i>á<i>n</i>, or Woman Chief, has her home beneath the earth, in one of the lower worlds.

To learn one of the great rites so as to become its <span class="corr" id="xd29e3119" title="Source: hatáli"><i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i</span> (chanter, singer),<a href="#not16" class="noteref">16</a> or priest, is the work of many years, and no one knows more than one such rite perfectly.
The older priests know something of other rites, may assist at them and sing songs
at them, but are not competent to conduct them. A priest of a great rite may know
some of the lesser rites.

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">89.</span> All the great ceremonies which the writer has witnessed among the Navahoes are primarily
for the healing of the sick; but the occasion is always used to ask the gods for various
temporal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>blessings, not only for the sick person but for all,&#x2014;the shaman, the relations of
the sick, and for the people in general. The invalid, for whose benefit the rite is
performed, defrays all the expenses of the ceremony, which often amount in value to
the sum of two hundred or three hundred dollars. The Navahoes being a scattered and
to some extent a wandering people who do not build towns, they lack the organization
to have rites of a more public character, such as the village Indians have.<a href="#not184" class="noteref">184</a> Hence these healing ceremonies, in which the sick man and his relations become hosts,
are used as occasions for prayer for the common weal, and as occasions in which large
numbers may assemble to witness interesting exhibitions and have the social enjoyments
which attend the gathering of a crowd.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">90.</span> <i>Minor Ceremonies.</i>&#x2014;Among the minor ceremonies, besides those for healing the sick, are those of planting,
harvesting, building, war, nubility, marriage, travel, and many other occasions in
life. In addition to these, there are ceremonies for special occasions, as for bringing
rain. During an unusually dry season a number of Navahoes may subscribe together and
raise a good fee for a priest to sing, pray, sacrifice, and conduct a ceremony to
bring rain.
</p>
<p id="par91"><span class="parNum">91.</span> <i>Origin of Ceremonies.</i>&#x2014;The late Mr. A.&nbsp;M. Stephen of Arizona, who for many years studied the rites and myths
of both Mokis and Navahoes, has often called the attention of the writer to the many
resemblances between the cults of these two tribes, who differ so much in other respects,
and he has suggested that the Navahoes may have borrowed from the Mokis. This may
be the case, for the Navahoes have, probably, people of Moki descent among them, and
they have had intercourse with the Mokis, both peaceful and warlike, for a long time.
But, throughout all the Navaho legends so far collected, it is strongly indicated
that the Navaho cultus, where borrowed, came from cliff-dwellers, from inhabitants
of pueblos now deserted, and from wild tribes. The Mokis figure but little in the
Navaho rite-myths. The author is inclined to believe that the Navahoes have not borrowed
much directly from the Mokis, but that both tribes have taken inspiration from common
sources. In radical points of symbolism, such as the sacred colors and the ceremonial
circuit, the Navaho and Moki rites differ widely.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">92.</span> <i>Elements of Ceremonies.</i>&#x2014;In the ceremonies there are numerous minor acts of such diverse character that they
cannot be classified and are not described in this work. They can be discussed better
in connection with the rites to which they belong. There are other acts of minor importance,
such as the ceremonial bath<a href="#not10" class="noteref">10</a> <a href="#not82" class="noteref">82</a> and the administration of pollen,<a href="#not11" class="noteref">11</a> which are considered in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>the notes. But there are six elements of the worship which constitute such important
parts in all the great rites that brief descriptions of them are presented in this
introduction. These six are: Sacrifice, painting, masquerade, dance, prayer, and song.
The last has been already discussed (<a href="#par41">par. 41</a> <i>et seq.</i>).
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">93.</span> <i>Sacrifices.</i>&#x2014;The sacrifices of the Navahoes are innocent and bloodless. Their kindly gods are
easily propitiated. Like their worshippers, they are all fond of tobacco, and they
prize a few feathers and beads. Even the chief war god demands no smoking hearts or
blood of captives; a little painted cigarette is all he asks in return for his favors.
An extensive chapter might be written about the sacrificial cigarettes and sticks
which the Navahoes call ke<i>t</i>án (Englished, kethawn), but a short description of them must suffice here. (See <a href="#not12">note 12</a>.)
</p>
<p id="par94"><span class="parNum">94.</span> <i>Cigarettes.</i>&#x2014;The cigarettes are usually made of the hollow joints of the common reed (<i lang="la">Phragmites communis</i>), but other plants are sometimes used. To form a cigarette, a piece of the reed is
cut off with a stone knife, the node being excluded; it is rubbed with sandstone,
so that the paint may adhere; it is painted with some symbolical device; a wad of
feathers is inserted into it to keep the tobacco from falling out; it is filled with
some kind of native tobacco,<a href="#not223" class="noteref">223</a> usually the <i lang="la">Nicotiana attenuata</i>, or ds&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>na&#x323;<i>t</i>o of the Navahoes; it is sealed with moistened pollen and symbolically lighted with
a rock crystal, which is held up to the sky and touched to the tip of the cigarette.
After it has been prayed over it is taken out and left for&#x2014;<i>i.e.</i>, sacrificed to&#x2014;the god for whom it is intended. The god, they say, recognizes it
by its symbolic painting and by the place where it is sacrificed. He picks it up,
smells and examines it. If he is satisfied that it is properly made and that it is
for him, he takes it and bestows on the supplicant the favors asked.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">95.</span> <i>Sacrificial Sticks.</i>&#x2014;Besides the cigarettes, small sticks are used as sacrifices to the gods. These are
made from a variety of woods,&#x2014;different gods and different occasions requiring woods
of different sorts,&#x2014;and they are painted in a variety of ways for the same reasons.
They are usually made in pairs, one for the male and the other for the female. Celibacy
is not practised by the Navaho gods; every deity has its mate, and she must be propitiated
as well as he. The female is distinguished in some way from the male, and this is
usually done by cutting a small facet at the tip end of the female stick (see <a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>), to represent the square mask worn by one who masquerades as a goddess in the ceremonies.
He who appears as a god wears a round cap-like mask (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>), and the round cut end of the stick sufficiently represents this.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">96.</span> Often the feathers of different kinds of birds are sacrificed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>with the kethawns, either attached to the latter or separate; also beads of stone
or shell and various kinds of powdered vegetable and mineral substances, including
pollen,<a href="#not11" class="noteref">11</a> which is the most sacred substance employed by the Navaho priests.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure fig25width" id="fig25"><img src="images/fig25.jpg" alt="Fig. 25. Kethawns (sacrificial sticks and cigarettes) in sacred basket, ready for sacrifice." width="513" height="490"><p class="figureHead"><span class="figNum">Fig. 25.</span> Kethawns (sacrificial sticks and cigarettes) in sacred basket, ready for sacrifice.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">97.</span> <i>Disposal of Kethawns.</i>&#x2014;The different ways in which kethawns are deposited or sacrificed are as numerous
as are their forms, materials, and decorations, and each way has its special symbolism.
Some are laid in the branches of a tree, others among rocks, others at the base of
a cliff, others, again, at the root of a tree, and others on level ground; a few are
thrown away almost at random, but most of them are laid down with care and with rigorous
ceremonial form. All that are laid with care are placed with their tips away from
the lodge, and each is destined to go toward some particular point of the compass.
When the bearer of the sacrifice leaves the lodge, he proceeds in the direction of
the place selected for the sacrifice; when he has deposited it he turns to the right
and takes a sunwise direction in returning. He does not cross his outgoing trail;
he must not walk through an ant-hill; he must run both going and coming.<a href="#not12" class="noteref">12</a>
</p>
<p id="par98"><span class="parNum">98.</span> <i>Ceremonial Pictures.</i>&#x2014;The pictures accompanying the Navaho rites are among the most transitory in the history
of art. In previous essays the author has called them dry-paintings. Similar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>works have been observed among other tribes, both nomadic and sedentary, and the observers
have designated them as &#x201c;sand-paintings,&#x201d; &#x201c;sand-altars,&#x201d; etc. They are drawn in all
the great rites, and even in some of the lesser rites&#x2014;those of only one day&#x2019;s duration&#x2014;small
but handsome dry-paintings are sometimes made. They vary in size from four to twelve
feet in diameter. Sometimes the fire in the centre of the medicine-lodge must be removed
in order to accommodate them. The groundwork is sand, which is conveyed in blankets
into the medicine-lodge, and spread out over the floor to the depth of about three
inches. It is smoothed with the broad oaken battens used in weaving.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">99.</span> Before the sand is brought in, the pigments are ground to powder and put on broad
pieces of pine bark, which serve as trays&#x2014;or palettes, shall we say? The pigments
are five in number,&#x2014;white, red, yellow, black, and gray. The white, red, and yellow
are made of sandstone. The black is made of powdered charcoal, with which a little
sandstone is mixed to facilitate the grinding and give weight to the powder. The gray,
made of black and white mixed in suitable proportions, is intended to represent blue,
is called blue by the Navahoes, and, combined with the other colors, has the effect
of blue in the paintings. It will be spoken of as blue in the subsequent descriptions.
The Navahoes use indigo and a native bluish mineral pigment to paint masks, kethawns,
and other small objects; but for the dry-paintings such a large quantity is needed
that these would be too expensive. To apply the colored powder, a pinch of it is taken
up between the thumb and first two fingers and allowed to fall slowly on the sand,
while the thumb is moved over the fingers.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">100.</span> To paint one of these large pictures may require the labor of several men&#x2014;a dozen
sometimes&#x2014;working from early morning till late in the afternoon. The picture must
be finished before dark, for it is impracticable to work on it with such artificial
lights as the Indians can command. While the work is in progress the priest who conducts
the ceremonies does little more than direct and criticise. The operators have received
a certain initiation. They have seen the picture painted before and are familiar with
its details. If an error is made the faulty part is not erased; sand is spread on
it to obliterate it, and the corrected drawing is made on the new deposit of sand.
The pictures are drawn according to exact and established rules. Some parts are measured
by palms and spans, and not a line of the sacred designs may be varied in them. In
drawing straight lines the colored powder is poured over a tightened cord. But in
a few cases the artist is allowed to indulge his fancy, thus, in drawing the embroidered
pouches which the gods <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>wear suspended at the waist (<a href="#plate1">plate I.</a>), the limner may, within certain limits, give his god as handsome a pouch as he wishes
and embroider it to suit his notion. The naked forms of the mythical characters are
drawn first and then the clothing and ornaments are laid on.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">101.</span> When the picture is finished a number of ceremonies (differing somewhat in different
rites) are performed over it. Pollen or corn-meal may be placed on certain parts of
the sacred figures, and one of these substances may be scattered over it. Water or
medicinal infusions may be applied to it. At length the patient is brought in and
placed sitting on the picture. Moistening his palms, the shaman or an assistant takes
the colored dust from various parts of the divine figures and applies it to similar
parts of the subject&#x2019;s body. Medicine is then usually administered in four draughts.
When the patient leaves, others in the lodge who are ill, or fancy themselves ill,
take dust on their palms from the picture and apply it to their own persons. He who
has headache takes dust from the head in the picture and applies it to his own head.
He who has sore feet takes dust from the pictured feet. When all are done the picture
is badly marred; it is then totally obliterated,&#x2014;the method and ceremony of obliteration
differing in different rites,&#x2014;and the sand on which it was drawn is taken out of the
lodge and thrown away. The floor on the lodge is swept, and the uninitiated, entering
a moment later, has no evidence of what has taken place.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">102.</span> <a href="#plate1">Plate I.</a> shows pictures of five different gods as they appear separately in the dry-paintings.
<a href="#fig29">Figure 29</a> represents, in black, a complete painting (the original of which was done in five
different colors) from the rite of the kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or the night chant. It will be observed that some of the gods or yéi of <a href="#plate1">plate I.</a> are to be seen in <a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">103.</span> The medicine-men declare that these pictures have been transmitted from teacher to
pupil, unchanged in all the years since they were revealed to the prophets of the
rites. There are good reasons for believing that this is not strictly true: the majority
of the great ceremonies may be performed only during the coldest part of the year,&#x2014;the
months when the snakes are dormant. No permanent copies of the pictures were ever
preserved until the author painted them; they were carried from season to season in
the memories of men, and there was no final authority in the tribe to settle questions
of correctness. But it is probable that changes, if they occurred, were unintentional
and wrought slowly. After the writer made copies of these pictures, and it became
known to the medicine-men that he had copies in his possession, it was not uncommon
for the shamans, pending the performance of a ceremony, to bring young men who were
to assist in the lodge, ask to see the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>paintings, and lecture on them to their pupils, pointing out the various important
points, and thus, no doubt, saving mistakes and corrections in the medicine-lodge.
The water-color copies were always (as the shamans knew) kept hidden at the forbidden
season, and never shown to the uninitiated of the tribe.

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">104.</span> <i>Masquerade.</i>&#x2014;In the rites, men appear representing gods or other mythic characters. Sometimes
such representations are effected by means of paint and equipment only, as in the
case of the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3327" title="Source: akáninili">akán&#x12d;n&#x12d;li</span>, or messenger of the mountain chant,<a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a> who is dressed to represent the prophet Ds&#x12d;&#x2032;lyi Neyáni as he appeared after the Butterfly
Goddess had transformed him; but on other occasions masks are added to the dress,
as in the rites of the night chant. In this there are twenty-one masks,<a href="#not267" class="noteref">267</a> made of sacred buckskin,<a href="#not13" class="noteref">13</a> for representatives of the gods to wear, besides a mask of yucca leaves<a href="#not14" class="noteref">14</a> trimmed with spruce twigs (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>), which the patient wears on one occasion. The buckskin masks, without plumes or
collars, are kept in a sack by the shaman, and he carries them on horseback to the
place where the rites are to be performed; there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>they are freshly painted, and the collars and plumes are added just before they are
to be used in the ceremony.
</p>
<p id="par105"><span class="parNum">105.</span> Plates IV. and VII. show the masks as they are actually worn, and exhibit men as
they are dressed and painted to represent the War Gods. In <a href="#plate1">plate I.</a> we get representations of these masks as they are depicted in the dry-paintings.
<a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a> shows the mask of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, the Talking God, as it appears when all is ready for the dance, with plume and
collar of fresh spruce twigs applied. <a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a> depicts the mask of a yébaad, or female yéi. The female masks cover only the face,
leaving the hair free. The male masks (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>) cover the entire head, concealing the hair.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">106.</span> When a man is dressed in his godly costume he does not speak; he only makes motions
and utters a peculiar cry,&#x2014;each god has his own special cry,&#x2014;and he may perform acts
on the patient with his special weapon or talisman. The masquerader, they say, is,
for the time being, no longer a Navaho, but a god, and a prayer to him is a prayer
to a god. When he enters the lodge and sits down before the sick man, the latter hands
him his sacrifice and prays to him devoutly, well knowing that it may be his own uncle
or cousin, disguised in the panoply of divinity, who receives the sacrifice.

<p><span class="parNum">107.</span> <i>Dance.</i>&#x2014;It has been customary with travellers to speak of Indian ceremonials as dances. This
is chiefly for the reason that the dance most attracts the attention of white men,
and the other portions of the work are likely to pass unheeded. Dancing is rarely
the most important element of an Indian ceremonial, and among the Navahoes it is always
a minor element. In some of the lesser rites it does not occur at all. In the nine
days&#x2019; ceremony of the mountain chant it occurs only on the last night, and then forms
but a part of the show,&#x2014;rude dramatic performances and feats of legerdemain (see <a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>) occupying about an equal time until the entertainment ends, soon after dawn. In
the nine days&#x2019; ceremony of the night chant, dancing as a part of the ceremony is confined
to the last night, although undress rehearsals of the dance take place after sunset
for a few days before.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure fig28width" id="fig28"><img src="images/fig28.jpg" alt="Fig. 28. Mask of yébaad or goddess." width="362" height="623"><p class="figureHead"><span class="figNum">Fig. 28.</span> Mask of yébaad or goddess.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">108.</span> These dances of the Navaho, although accompanied with religious symbolism, and performed
often by men wearing sacred costumes, are undoubtedly intended largely to entertain
the spectators. While but a few people may be present during the first eight or nine
days of a great ceremony, a large crowd always gathers to witness the performances
of the last night, and many people stay up all night to do this. On the last night
of the mountain chant the dances are picturesque and various. Many of them are borrowed
from other rites. They have been described by the author in a previous work. On the
last night of the night chant the dance and song vary but little, and to the ordinary
observer may seem not to vary at all. Yet the spectators who come to the mountain
chant are not more wakeful and watchful than those who come to the night chant. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>dancing is always rhythmical and well-timed. Figures are often introduced like those
of our quadrilles; but no round dances, like our waltz or polka, have been observed&#x2014;the
rough ground is not suited for such. The dancers and the drummers practise long in
private before coming to the public exhibition.

<p><span class="parNum">109.</span> <i>Prayer.</i>&#x2014;In a paper entitled &#x201c;The Prayer of a Navaho Shaman,&#x201d;<a href="#not315" class="noteref">315</a> the author has published a long composition, called a prayer by the man from whom
he received it, which is a simple narrative and does not contain a word of supplication.
This is the only prayer of such character obtained from a Navaho. Many other long
prayers have been recorded, all of which are formed on a common plan. The name of
a god is mentioned, and some flattering attributes are given to him. If it is a god
such as <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, of which there are more than one of the same name, his residence is mentioned.
He is informed that sacrifices have been prepared for him. He is asked to remove the
spell of disease. Immediately he is assured that it is removed. Then he is asked to
bestow various blessings on the supplicant and all his kindred and people. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>prayer is given out, one sentence at a time, by the shaman, and the patient repeats
it after him, sentence by sentence.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">110.</span> These prayers, repeated by two voices, sound much like litanies, and all end with
an expression (<i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óna <i>h</i>astlé) analogous to the amen of Christian prayers, four times repeated; yet the Navaho
prayers show in their spirit no indication of the influence of Christian teaching.
They are purely pagan compositions. The only evidence of any modern influence they
present is the occasional inclusion of a request for increase of wealth in the shape
of horses and sheep. A typical Navaho prayer from the rites of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> is given in <a href="#not288">note 288</a>.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">111.</span> Besides these long prayers, repeated by two persons, the shamans have many monologue
prayers; there are prayers silent and vocal, formulated and extempore, used by both
priest and layman; and there are short devotional sayings which may be classed as
benedictions and ejaculations.

<h3 class="main">THE LEGENDS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">112.</span> Of the many lengthy myths and legends obtained by the author from the Navahoes, three
have been selected for publication in this volume. The first is the Origin Legend
of the tribe; the other two are incomplete rite-myths, <i>i.e.</i>, rite-myths told by men who were not priests of the associated rites.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">113.</span> <i>Versions.</i>&#x2014;As might be expected among an unlettered people, thinly scattered over a wide territory,
the legends of the Navahoes have many variants. No two men will tell the same tale
exactly alike, and each story-teller will probably maintain that his own version is
the only reliable one. Variations of the Origin Legend, which is the property of the
tribe at large, and, unlike the rite-myths, is not in the keeping of any especial
order or priesthood, are particularly numerous; but even in the rite-myths, as told
by priests of the rites, versions may be found. Notwithstanding these varieties, the
tale-tellers agree substantially in the more important matters. Of the two rite-myths
given in this work, only one version of each was procured; but several versions of
the Origin Legend, complete or partial, were recorded. The one here published was
selected as being the most complete, extensive, and consistent of all. Other versions
often supplement it. The narrators sometimes acknowledged that they had forgotten
episodes which others had remembered and detailed. The learned old shaman, <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i N&#x115;z, forgot to tell how the stars were made; while a younger and less erudite person,
Jake the silversmith, related a fair version of this episode, which came also from
other sources to the writer. Jake&#x2019;s version of the Legend, which has already been
published, is designated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>in the notes as Version B;<a href="#not306" class="noteref">306</a> that of old Torlino, a priest of the <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, is designated as Version A. Other versions are alluded to, but not designated by
letter or number. Some fragmentary versions by other authors<a href="#not291" class="noteref">291</a> <a href="#not300" class="noteref">300</a> have been published, but these are not quoted in the notes.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">114.</span> <i>Origin Legend.</i>&#x2014;The Origin Legend divides itself into four very distinct parts or chapters, which
are named: I. The Story of the Emergence; II. Early Events in the Fifth World; III.
The War Gods; IV. The Growth of the Navaho Nation. The name of the first part is that
given to it by the Navaho story-tellers. The names of the other parts are supplied
by the author. The first part, The Story of the Emergence, ends when it is related
that the people came out from the fourth world to the surface of this, the fifth world.<a href="#not15" class="noteref">15</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">115.</span> <i>Rite-myths.</i>&#x2014;By a rite-myth is meant a myth which accounts for the work of a ceremony, for its
origin, for its introduction among the Navahoes, or for all these things combined.
The Navahoes celebrate long and costly ceremonies, many of which are of nine days&#x2019;
duration. Each ceremony has connected with it one or more myths, or legends which
may not be altogether mythical.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">116.</span> When a rite-myth is told by a priest of the rite to which the myth belongs, minute
and often tedious particulars concerning the rite, its work, symbolism, and sacrifices
are introduced into the tale. When such a myth is told by one who is not a priest
of the rite (although he may be a priest of some other rite), these esoteric parts
are altogether omitted, or only briefly alluded to. To the latter class belong the
two rite-myths given in this book. They are here published because they are among
the most interesting and ingenious that have been collected among the Navahoes. The
attention of the reader is directed, in the notes, to a few places where esoteric
or ceremonial matters are thought to be referred to. Tales containing ceremonial allusions
in full are reserved for future publication, along with a description of the rites
to which they pertain, as such is considered the more appropriate place for their
publication.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">117.</span> In one version of the Origin Legend (Version A) a portion of this story is used as
a rite-myth. It is embellished with prayers and songs, and interspersed with allusions
to ceremonial work which the version of <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i N&#x115;z does not contain; but in other respects it is inferior to the latter. Thus embellished
it contributes a share to the myth of the ceremony of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or chant of terrestrial beauty. Even in the version of <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i N&#x115;z, the songs seem introduced from some rite-myth, and scarcely to belong to the
original story.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">118.</span> Whenever an opportunity has occurred of studying a rite with its associated myth,
it has been found that the myth never explains all the symbolism of the rite, although
it may account for all the more important acts. A primitive and underlying symbolism,
which probably existed previous to the establishment of the rite, remains unexplained
by the myth, as though its existence were taken as a matter of course, and required
no explanation. Some explanation of this foundation symbolism may be found in the
Origin Legend, or in other early legends of the tribe; but something remains which
even these do not explain.

<p><span class="parNum">119.</span> <i>Myths of the Whirling Logs.</i>&#x2014;In the ceremony of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> there is drawn upon the floor of the medicine-lodge a large dry-painting which is
very imperfectly represented in <a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>. The original was wrought in five colors and was about 12 feet in diameter. It depicts
a vision of the prophet Béla<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>&#x12d;ni, who established the rites of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>. On one occasion, says the tale, he was led, in the San Juan valley, to a lake on
the borders of which grew four stalks of sacred corn, each of a different color. In
the centre of the lake lay two logs crossing one another at right angles. Near both
ends of each log sat a pair of yéi, or genii, male and female, making eight in all.
On the shore of the lake stood four more yéi, three of whom had staves, by means of
which they kept the crossed logs away from the shore and whirling in the waters. The
rainbow goddess, the anthropomorphic rainbow of the Navahoes, surrounded the lake.
All the circumstances of this strange scene are duly symbolized in the painting.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">120.</span> It was in his efforts to get a further explanation of this extraordinary picture
that the author came upon the story of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani. It is not the story that explains the picture, although certain passages in it
(<a href="#par481">pars. 481</a>, <a href="#par488">488</a>) might seem to explain it. The story to which the picture belongs is that of Béla<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>&#x12d;ni, which may some day be published in connection with a description of the ceremony
of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or the night chant. The prophet Béla<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>&#x12d;ni, according to the tale, floated down the San Juan River in a hollow log, until
he came to the whirling lake, where he saw the vision depicted in the dry-painting.
But when the shaman had finished telling the story of Béla<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>&#x12d;ni he said: &#x201c;There is another story of a man who floated down the San Juan River
in a hollow log. It is a story belonging to a different rite, the atsósid<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>. Would you like to hear it?&#x201d; It was thus that the story of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani came to be told. The narrator of the two tales was a priest of the kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, but not of the atsósid<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>; hence one tale is crowded with allusions to acts in the ceremony, while the other,
as here published, has few such allusions.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">121.</span> <i>The Great Shell of K&#x12d;ntyél.</i>&#x2014;The story of the Great Shell of K&#x12d;ntyél, as here given, is a fragment of a rite-myth,&#x2014;the
myth of the yóid<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or yói <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i><a href="#not250" class="noteref">250</a> (bead chant), a nine days&#x2019; healing ceremony. It conveys a moral often found in Navaho
tales, which is, that we must not despise the poor and humble. They may be favored
by the gods and prove themselves, to-morrow, more potent than those who yesterday
despised and mocked them. It also signalizes the triumph of a poor Navaho over wealthy
Pueblos.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">122.</span> <i>Translation of Legends.</i>&#x2014;In rendering the Navaho tales into English, the author has not confined himself to
a close literal translation. Such translation would often be difficult to understand,
and, more often still, be uninteresting reading. He has believed it to be his duty
to make a readable translation, giving the spirit of the original rather than the
exact words. The tales were told in fluent Navaho, easy of comprehension, and of such
literary perfection as to hold the hearer&#x2019;s attention. They should be translated into
English of a similar character, even if words have to be added to make the sense clear.
Such privileges are taken by the translators of the Bible and of the classic authors.
Still the writer has taken pains never to exceed the metaphor or descriptive force
of the original, and never to add a single thought of his own. If he has erred in
rendering the spirit of the savage authors, it has been by diminishing rather than
by exaggerating. He has erred on the side of safety. He has endeavored to &#x201c;tune the
sitar&#x201d; rather low than high.<a href="#not15a" class="noteref">15<i>a</i></a> Again, the original was often embellished with pantomime and vocal modulation which
expressed more than the mere words, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>and which the writer is unable to represent, and it contained extemporized onomatopes
which no letters can express.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">123.</span> <i>Texts.</i>&#x2014;The men who narrated to the author the tales contained in this book were not men
of unlimited leisure, as many suppose the Indians to be; they were popular shamans,
or medicine-men, who had numerous engagements to conduct ceremonies during the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3715" title="Source: winter">summer</span> months, and it was only during the winter months that they permitted themselves to
tell the tales. It was usually with difficulty that arrangements were made with one
of these shamans to devote a period of two or three weeks to the service of the author.
Then, too, they had farms and stock which demanded their care. Neither was the author
a man of unbounded leisure. Rarely could he devote more than two or three hours out
of twenty-four to the work of ethnography. It has happened more than once that he
has been obliged to break an engagement made with a shaman, at a cost of considerable
trouble and money, in order to go on detached service away from his proper station.
For these reasons it was not practicable to record the original Indian texts of all
the stories. The author had to choose between copious texts and copious tales. He
chose the latter. But some texts have been recorded. In order that the reader may
judge how closely the liberal translation here offered follows the original, the Navaho
text of the opening passages&#x2014;ten paragraphs&#x2014;of the Origin Legend, with interlinear
translations, are given in the notes. The texts of songs, prayers, and interesting
passages may also be found in the notes.

<h3 class="main">ALPHABET USED.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">124.</span> Ever since the present alphabet of the Bureau of Ethnology was established (in 1880),
it has been the author&#x2019;s custom to use it in spelling Indian words. But heretofore
he has written mostly for the scientific world, for ethnologists and philologists
who either were familiar with the alphabet, or were willing to constantly refer to
it in reading. As the present work is designed to reach a wider circle of readers,
the propriety of using the alphabet of the Bureau becomes doubtful. Many of the author&#x2019;s
friends have begged him not to use it in this collection of tales, believing that
its unusual characters would embarrass the average reader and detract from the interest
of the work. Another system has, therefore, been devised, according to which consonants
printed in Roman letters have the ordinary English sounds, while those printed in
Italics have sounds analogous to the English but not identical with them. The vowels,
when unmarked, have the continental sounds. When these sounds are modified, diacritical
marks are added in accordance with the latest edition of Webster&#x2019;s Dictionary. The
sound of English a in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>what is indicated by a&#x323;. The only diphthong is ai, which has the sound of English
i in pine. One mark not employed in Webster&#x2019;s orthoepy is used in this book, viz.,
the inverted comma after a vowel to show that it is aspirated.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">125.</span> According to this arrangement, the casual reader will find the Indian words easily
legible. If he takes the trouble to consult this and the preceding paragraph he may
pronounce the words almost exactly as a Navaho would; if not he may, at least, pronounce
them in a way that few Navahoes would fail to comprehend. At all events, to the majority
of readers, a perfect pronunciation of the Indian words is immaterial. Many white
men, living within the borders of the Navaho land, converse with these Indians in
a jargon or debased language which might be spelled in English characters with their
ordinary English values. For example, let us take the word for hut or house. This
is properly pronounced <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án; but the whites in New Mexico generally call it hogán, and the Navahoes never fail to understand the word as thus pronounced. In this form
it is an adopted English word in the Southwest. The following are the values of the
consonants when printed in Italics:&#x2014;
</p>
<p><i>d</i> has the sound of English th in this.
</p>
<p><i>g</i> has a sound unknown in English, gh imperfectly represents it. It is the g of the
Dakota, or the Arabic <i>ghain</i>.
</p>
<p><i>h</i> has the sound of German ch in machen.
</p>
<p><i>l</i> is an aspirated l unknown in English, hl imperfectly represents it. It is formed
with the side rather than with the tip of the tongue.
</p>
<p><i>s</i> has the sound of English sh in shot.
</p>
<p><i>t</i> has the sound of English th in thing.
</p>
<p><i>z</i> has the sound of English z in azure.
</p>
<p>c, j, q, r, and x are not used. The sound of English ch in church is represented by
t<i>s</i>; that of English j in jug, by d<i>z</i>.

<h3 class="main">SPELLING OF NAVAHO.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">126.</span> In the many papers about the Navahoes which the author has previously written he
has spelled the name of the tribe according to the Spanish system &#x201c;Navajo,&#x201d; with the
plural also in Spanish form, &#x201c;Navajos.&#x201d; In the present work he spells it, according
to English orthography, &#x201c;Navaho,&#x201d; with an English plural, &#x201c;Navahoes,&#x201d; and he thus
intends to spell it in the future. This he does because the Spanish spelling is misleading
to the majority of English readers. It may properly be asked why he should adopt an
English orthography for Navaho, a name of Spanish origin, while he retains the misleading
Spanish orthography of San Juan. It is not sufficient, in reply, to say that the territory
of the Navaho has been in the possession of the United States since 1848, and that
we have thus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>acquired the right to spell this name in our own way; for a thousand other names of
Spanish origin have marked our map as long, which we never ventured to change, either
in spelling or pronunciation. Perhaps the best defence to be made of our course is
that the name Navaho exists nowhere but within our borders. If we change the spelling
here, we do not conflict with the spelling elsewhere. But there are scores of San
Juans in Spanish America. We could not change the spelling of our San Juan without
confusion. It were better that we should follow the example of Lord Byron and pronounce
it Jew&#x2032;an; but this the people of the Southwest will probably never do. They will
speak of the stream as the &#x201c;San W&#x14f;n&#x201d; or the &#x201c;San Wh&#x14f;n&#x201d; for all time. Furthermore,
the English spelling of Navaho is not a new thing with the writer. Many have already
adopted it.

<h3 class="main">NOTES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">126.</span> In preparing the notes the author has usually limited himself to such matters as
he believes he only can explain, or such as, at least, he can explain better than
any one else. In a few cases he has given information on subjects not generally known
and not easily to be investigated. The temptation to wander into the seductive paths
of comparative mythology, and to speculate on the more recondite significance of the
myths, had to be resisted if the work were to be kept within the limits of one volume.
Resemblances between the tales of the Navahoes and those of other peoples, civilized
and savage, ancient and modern, are numerous and marked; but space devoted to them
would be lost to more important subjects. Again, many of the readers of this book
may be prepared, better than the author, to note these resemblances.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">127.</span> So much has been said against the medicine-men of the Indians by various writers,
who accuse them of being reactionaries, mischief-makers, and arrant deceivers, that
the writer feels constrained to give some testimony in their favor,&#x2014;in favor, at least,
of those he has met among the Navahoes; he will not speak now for other tribes.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">128.</span> There are, among the Navahoes, charlatans and cheats who treat disease; men who pretend
to suck disease out of the patient and then draw from their own mouths pebbles, pieces
of charcoal, or bodies of insects, claiming that these are the disease which they
have extracted. But the priests of the great rites are not to be classed with such.
All of these with whom the writer is acquainted are above such trickery. They perform
their ceremonies in the firm conviction that they are invoking divine aid, and their
calling lends <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>dignity to their character. They interfere little with the political affairs of the
tribe.

</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">129.</span> <i>Smiling Chanter.</i>&#x2014;It is a source of great regret that a better likeness cannot be presented of <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i Natlói than that shown in <a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>. It is reproduced from a painting which was copied from a dim kodak photograph. His
name may be translated Smiling Chanter, or Smiling Doctor; an angry or unpleasant
expression is never seen on his face. He is also called <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i Pa<i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni, which may be translated Happy or Good-natured Chanter. He is a priest of the
<span class="corr" id="xd29e3833" title="Source: kledzi">kléd<i>z</i>i</span> <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or night chant. He would be considered a man of high character in any community.
He is dignified, courteous, kind, honest, truthful, and self-respecting. But his dignity
is not of the pompous kind. He has a keen sense of humor, makes an excellent joke,
and is a good mimic; but, for all his fun, he is neither <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>vulgar nor unkind. He never begged from the author, and never made a bargain with
him in advance for his services, or named a price for them when he was done. He always
took the greatest pains to explain everything, and, after the writer had been duly
initiated into the mysteries of his order, he withheld nothing. To him we are indebted
for the story of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">130.</span> <i>Tall Chanter.</i>&#x2014;<a href="#fig32">Figure 32</a> represents an aged priest named <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i N&#x115;z, or Tall Chanter. He was the first who could be persuaded to explain to the
author the ceremonies or relate the rite-myths; but when he set the example, others
were found to follow. He also is a priest of the night chant. Of late years he has
become unpopular as a shaman, owing to an increasing irritability of temper; but he
exhibits no envy of his more popular rivals. He perhaps has a better knowledge of
the legends than any other man in the tribe. Before he would confide any of his secrets
to the author he said: &#x201c;The chanters among the Navahoes are all brothers. If you would
learn our secrets you must be one of us. You must forever be a brother to me. Do you
promise this?&#x201d; He has ever since addressed the author as <i>S</i>its&#x12d;&#x2032;li, &#x201c;My younger brother,&#x201d; and has in turn been called <i>S</i>inái, &#x201c;My elder brother.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">131.</span> <i>Ethics.</i>&#x2014;Among themselves, these men have a code of ethics which is, in general, more honestly
upheld than the code of our own medical profession. They exhibit no jealousy of one
another. They boast not of the excellence of the particular rite they practise. They
assist and counsel one another. If a medicine-man, in performing a rite, finds that
his supply of some sacred article is exhausted, he sends to the nearest medicine-man
for it. If the latter has it, he is obliged to give, and is not allowed to receive
payment in return.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">132.</span> <i>Torlino.</i>&#x2014;They are as willing as any other Indians to learn the white man&#x2019;s philosophy. Old
Torlino, a priest of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, sent a son to school at Carlisle, and when the young man returned he no doubt imparted
to his father much that he had learned there. The writer sent for the old man to get
from him the myth of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>. Torlino began: &#x201c;I know the white men say the world is round, and that it floats
in the air. My tale says the world is flat, and that there are five worlds, one above
another. You will not believe my tale, then, and perhaps you do not want to hear it.&#x201d;
Being assured that the tale was earnestly desired, despite of all white men&#x2019;s theories,
he proceeded. &#x201c;I shall tell you the truth, then. I shall tell you all that I heard
from the old men who taught me, as well as I can now remember. Why should I lie to
you?&#x201d; And then he made the interesting asseveration which is here literally translated:
&#x201c;I am ashamed before the earth; I am ashamed before the heavens; I am ashamed before
the dawn; I am ashamed before the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>evening twilight; I am ashamed before the blue sky; I am ashamed before the darkness;
I am ashamed before the sun; I am ashamed before that standing within me which speaks
with me (my conscience!).<a href="#not274" class="noteref">274</a> Some of these things are always looking at me. I am never out of sight. Therefore
I must tell the truth. That is why I always tell the truth. I hold my word tight to
my breast.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">133.</span> <i>Medical Practice.</i>&#x2014;Often have the shamans come to the author for treatment for themselves and their
friends, and they never made any secret of this, but asked for medicine in the presence
of the laity of their own tribe. They do not pretend to deal in panaceas. On the other
hand, in cases where the author has failed to give prompt relief to a sick Indian,
they have come in all sincerity and politeness and said, &#x201c;I know a remedy for that
difficulty. Will you let me try it?&#x201d; They do not confine themselves to the practice
of their shamanistic rites. They use various plants in the treatment of disease, and
these, in simple, acute cases, they administer without prayer, sacrifice, or incantation.

humble volume and cull from it facts and fancies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>which, clothed in fairer diction, may add interest to their pages. The author does
not ask that such writers shall acknowledge the source of their inspiration. This
is more than he has a right to expect. Our greatest poets have borrowed from sources
as obscure and never named their creditors. The author has often, ere now, experienced
the pleasure of seeing his thoughts and discoveries blazoned in print over other names.
But he ventures to make a few requests of the literary borrower. He begs that the
latter will not garble or distort what is here written,&#x2014;that he will not put alien
thoughts into the minds of these pagan heroes; that he will not arm them with the
weapons nor clothe them in the habiliments of an alien race; that he will not make
them act incongruous parts.

<p><span class="parNum">135.</span> Stephen Powers, in his &#x201c;Tribes of California&#x201d;<a href="#not326" class="noteref">326</a> (page 38), gives, in simple and direct language, the story of how fire came to the
Karok nation. A few years after he wrote, some one worked his story into a &#x201c;poem,&#x201d;
which appeared, most artistically illustrated, in one of our leading magazines. In
this poem the Coyote, in a quandary, is represented as &#x201c;stroking his goatee.&#x201d; Coyotes
have no goatees; Indians have no goatees. The act of stroking the goatee, in thought
or perplexity, is the special mannerism of a nervous American. No allusion could be
more out of place in an Indian legend. Should the poet referred to ever select any
of the tales in this book to be tortured into a poem, I beg that he will not, even
for the sake of making a faulty rhyme, put a beard on the chin of the Navaho Coyote
God.

the north an ocean. In the ocean to the east lay Tiéholtsodi; he was chief of the
people there. In the ocean to the south lived <i>T</i><i>h</i>altlá<i>h</i>ale (Blue Heron), who was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>chief of the people there.

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">141.</span> The people quarrelled among themselves, and this is the way it happened. They committed
adultery, one people with another. Many of the women were guilty. They tried to stop
it, but they could not. Tiéholtsodi, the chief in the east, said: &#x201c;What shall we do
with them? They like not the land they dwell in.&#x201d; In the south Blue Heron spoke to
them, and in the west Frog said: &#x201c;No longer shall you dwell here, I say. I am chief
here.&#x201d; To the north White Mountain Lightning said: &#x201c;Go elsewhere at once. Depart from
here!&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">142.</span> When again they sinned and again they quarrelled, Tiéholtsodi, in the east, would
not speak to them; Blue Heron, in the south, would not speak to them; Frog, in the
west, would say nothing; and White Mountain Thunder, in the north, would not speak
to them.
</p>
<p id="par143"><span class="parNum">143.</span> Again, at the end of four nights, the same thing happened. Those who dwelt at the
south again committed crime, and again they had contentions. One woman and one man
sought to enter in the east (to complain to the chief), but they were driven out.
In the south they sought to go in where Blue Heron lay, but again they were driven
out. In the west, where Frog was the chief, again they tried to enter; but again they
were driven out. To the north again they were driven out. (The chief) said: &#x201c;None
of you (shall enter here). Go elsewhere and keep on going.&#x201d; That night at Naho<i>d</i>oóla they held a council, but they arrived at no decision. At dawn Tiéholtsodi began
to talk. &#x201c;You pay no attention to my words. Everywhere you disobey me; you must go
to some other place. Not upon this earth shall you remain.&#x201d; Thus he spoke to them.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">144.</span> Among the women, for four nights they talked about it. At the end of the fourth night,
in the morning, as they were rising, something white appeared in the east. It appeared
also in the south, the west, and the north. It looked like a chain of mountains, without
a break, stretching around them. It was water that surrounded them. Water impassable,
water insurmountable, flowed all around. All at once they started.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">145.</span> They went in circles upward till they reached the sky. It was smooth. They looked
down; but there the water had risen, and there was nothing else but water there. While
they were flying around, one having a blue head thrust out his head from the sky and
called to them, saying: &#x201c;In here, to the eastward, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>there is a hole.&#x201d; They entered the hole and went through it up to the surface (of
the second world).
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">146.</span> The blue one belonged to the <span class="corr" id="xd29e4213" title="Source: Hastsósid&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;"><i>H</i>a<i>s</i>t<i>s</i>ó<i>s</i>i<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;</span>, or Swallow People.<a href="#not21" class="noteref">21</a> The Swallow People lived there. A great many of their houses, rough and lumpy, lay
scattered all around. Each tapered toward the top, and at that part there was a hole
for entrance. A great many people approached and gathered around<a href="#not275" class="noteref">275</a> the strangers, but they said nothing.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">147.</span> The first world was red in color; the second world, into which the people had now
entered, was blue.<a href="#not22" class="noteref">22</a> They sent out two couriers, a Locust and a White Locust, to the east, to explore
the land and see if there were in it any people like themselves. At the end of two
days the couriers returned, and said that in one day&#x2019;s travel they had reached the
edge of the world&#x2014;the top of a great cliff that arose from an abyss whose bottom they
could not see; but that they found in all their journey no people, no animals of any
kind, no trees, no grass, no sage-brush, no mountains, nothing but bare, level ground.
The same couriers were then dispatched in turn to the south, to the west, and to the
north. They were gone on each journey two days, and when they returned related, as
before, that they had reached the edge of the world, and discovered nothing but an
uninhabited waste. Here, then, the strangers found themselves in the centre of a vast
barren plain, where there was neither food nor a kindred people. When the couriers
had returned from the north, the Swallows visited the camp of the newly arrived people,
and asked them why they had sent out the couriers to the east. &#x201c;We sent them out,&#x201d;
was the reply, &#x201c;to see what was in the land, and to see if there were any people like
ourselves here.&#x201d; &#x201c;And what did your couriers tell you?&#x201d; asked the Swallows. &#x201c;They
told us that they came to the edge of the world, yet found no plant and no living
thing in all the land.&#x201d; (The same questions were asked and the same answers given
for the other points of the compass.) &#x201c;They spoke the truth,&#x201d; said the Swallow People.
&#x201c;Had you asked us in the beginning what the land contained, we would have told you
and saved you all your trouble. Until you came, no one has ever dwelt in all this
land but ourselves.&#x201d; The people then said to the Swallows: &#x201c;You understand our language
and are much like us. You have legs, feet, bodies, heads, and wings, as we have: why
cannot your people and our people become friends?&#x201d; &#x201c;Let it be as you wish,&#x201d; said the
Swallows, and both parties began at once to treat each other as members of one tribe;
they mingled one among the other, and addressed one another by the terms of relationship,
as, my brother, my sister, my father, my son, etc.<a href="#not23" class="noteref">23</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">148.</span> They all lived together pleasantly and happily for twenty-three days; but on the
twenty-fourth night one of the strangers made too free with the wife of the Swallow
chief, and next morning, when the latter found out what had happened, he said to the
strangers: &#x201c;We have treated you as friends, and thus you return our kindness. We doubt
not that for such crimes you were driven from the lower world, and now you must leave
this. This is our land and we will have you here no longer. Besides, this is a bad
land. People are dying here every day, and, even if we spare you, you cannot live
here long.&#x201d; The Locusts took the lead on hearing this; they soared upwards; the others
followed, and all soared and circled till they reached the sky.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">149.</span> When they reached the sky they found it, like the sky of the first world, smooth
and hard with no opening; but while they were circling round under it, they saw a
white face peering out at them,&#x2014;it was the face of N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i, the Wind. He called to them and told them if they would fly to the south they would
find a hole through which they could pass; so off they flew, as bidden, and soon they
discovered a slit in the sky which slanted upwards toward the south; through this
slit they flew, and soon entered the third world in the south.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">150.</span> The color of the third world was yellow.<a href="#not22" class="noteref">22</a> Here they found nothing but the Grasshopper People. The latter gathered around the
wanderers in great numbers, but said nothing. They lived in holes in the ground along
the banks of a great river which flowed through their land to the east. The wanderers
sent out the same Locust messengers that they had sent out in the second world to
explore the land to the east, to the south, to the west, to the north, to find out
what the land contained, and to see if there were any kindred people in it; but the
messengers returned from each journey after an absence of two days, saying they had
reached the end of the world, and that they had found a barren land with no people
in it save the Grasshoppers.<a href="#not24" class="noteref">24</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">151.</span> When the couriers returned from their fourth journey, the two great chiefs of the
Grasshoppers visited the strangers and asked them why they had sent out the explorers,
and the strangers answered that they had sent them out to see what grew in the land,
and to find if there were any people like themselves in it. &#x201c;And what did your couriers
find?&#x201d; said the Grasshopper chiefs. &#x201c;They found nothing save the bare land and the
river, and no people but yourselves.&#x201d; &#x201c;There is nothing else in the land,&#x201d; said the
chiefs. &#x201c;Long we have lived here, but we have seen no other people but ourselves until
you came.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">152.</span> The strangers then spoke to the Grasshoppers, as they had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>spoken to the Swallows in the second world, and begged that they might join them and
become one people with them. The Grasshoppers consented, and the two peoples at once
mingled among one another and embraced one another, and called one another by the
endearing terms of relationship, as if they were all of the same tribe.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">153.</span> As before, all went well for twenty-three days; but on the twenty-fourth one of the
strangers served a chief of the Grasshoppers as the chief of the Swallows had been
served in the lower world. In the morning, when the wrong was discovered, the chief
reviled the strangers and bade them depart. &#x201c;For such crimes,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I suppose
you were chased from the world below: you shall drink no more of our water, you shall
breathe no more of our air. Begone!&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">154.</span> Up they all flew again, and circled round and round until they came to the sky above
them, and they found it smooth and hard as before. When they had circled round for
some time, looking in vain for an entrance, they saw a red head stuck out of the sky,
and they heard a voice which told them to fly to the west. It was the head of Red
Wind which they saw, and it was his voice that spoke to them. The passage which they
found in the west was twisted round like the tendril of a vine; it had thus been made
by the wind. They flew up in circles through it and came out in the fourth world.
Four of the Grasshoppers came with them; one was white, one blue, one yellow, and
one black. We have grasshoppers of these four colors with us to this day.<a href="#not25" class="noteref">25</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">155.</span> The surface of the fourth world was mixed black and white. The colors in the sky
were the same as in the lower worlds, but they differed in their duration. In the
first world, the white, the blue, the yellow, and the black all lasted about an equal
length of time every day. In the second world the blue and the black lasted a little
longer than the other two colors. In the third world they lasted still longer. In
the fourth world there was but little of the white and yellow; the blue and the black
lasted most of the time. As yet there was neither sun, moon, nor star.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">156.</span> When they arrived on the surface of the fourth world they saw no living thing; but
they observed four great snow-covered peaks sticking up at the horizon,&#x2014;one at the
east, one at the south, one at the west, and one at the north.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">157.</span> They sent two couriers to the east. These returned at the end of two days. They related
that they had not been able to reach the eastern mountain, and that, though they had
travelled far, they had seen no track or trail or sign of life. Two couriers were
then sent to the south. When they returned, at the end of two days, they related that
they had reached a low range of mountains this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>side of the great peak; that they had seen no living creature, but had seen two different
kinds of tracks, such as they had never seen before, and they described such as the
deer and the turkey make now. Two couriers were next sent to the west. In two days
these returned, having failed to reach the great peak in the west, and having seen
no living thing and no sign of life. At last two couriers were sent to the north.
When these got back to their kindred they said they had found a race of strange men,
who cut their hair square in front, who lived in houses in the ground and cultivated
fields. These people, who were engaged in gathering their harvest, the couriers said,
treated them very kindly and gave them food to eat. It was now evident to the wanderers
that the fourth world was larger than any of the worlds below.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">158.</span> The day following the return of the couriers who went to the north, two of the newly
discovered race&#x2014;Kisáni (Pueblos) they were called&#x2014;entered the camp of the exiles and
guided the latter to a stream of water. The water was red, and the Kisáni told the
wanderers they must not walk through the stream, for if they did the water would injure
their feet. The Kisáni showed them a square raft made of four logs,&#x2014;a white pine,
a blue spruce, and yellow pine, and a black spruce,&#x2014;on which they might cross; so
they went over the stream and visited the homes of the Kisáni.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">159.</span> The Kisáni gave the wanderers corn and pumpkins to eat, and the latter lived for
some time on the food given to them daily by their new friends. They held a council
among themselves, in which they resolved to mend their manners for the future and
do nothing to make the Kisáni angry. The land of the Kisáni had neither rain nor snow;
the crops were raised by irrigation.
</p>
<p id="par160"><span class="parNum">160.</span> Late in the autumn they heard in the east the distant sound of a great voice calling.
They listened and waited, and soon heard the voice nearer and louder. They listened
still and heard the voice a third time, nearer and louder than before. Once more they
listened, and soon they heard the voice louder still, and clear like the voice of
one near at hand. A moment later four mysterious beings appeared to them.<a href="#not26" class="noteref">26</a> These were: B&#x12d;tsís <i>L</i>akaí, or White Body, a being like the god of this world whom the Navahoes call <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i; B&#x12d;tsís <i>D</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>, or Blue Body, who was like the present Navaho god <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li, or Water Sprinkler; B&#x12d;tsís <i>L</i>&#x12d;tsói, or Yellow Body; and B&#x12d;tsís <i>L</i>&#x12d;z&#x12d;&#x2032;n, or Black Body, who was the same as the present Navaho god of fire, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">161.</span> These beings, without speaking, made many signs to the people, as if instructing
them; but the latter did not understand them. When the gods had gone, the people long
discussed the mysterious visit, and tried to make out what the gods meant by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>signs they had made. Thus the gods visited four days in succession. On the fourth
day, when the other three had departed, Black Body remained behind and spoke to the
people in their own language. He said: &#x201c;You do not seem to understand the signs that
these gods make you, so I must tell you what they mean. They want to make more people,
but in form like themselves. You have bodies like theirs; but you have the teeth,
the feet, and the claws of beasts and insects. The new creatures are to have hands
and feet like ours. But you are uncleanly, you smell badly. Have yourselves well cleansed
when we return; we will come back in twelve days.&#x201d;
</p>
<p id="par162"><span class="parNum">162.</span> On the morning of the twelfth day the people washed themselves well. The women dried
themselves with yellow corn-meal; the men with white corn-meal.<a href="#not27" class="noteref">27</a> Soon after the ablutions were completed they heard the distant call of the approaching
gods. It was shouted, as before, four times,&#x2014;nearer and louder at each repetition,&#x2014;and,
after the fourth call, the gods appeared. Blue Body and Black Body each carried a
sacred buckskin. White Body carried two ears of corn, one yellow, one white, each
covered at the end completely with grains.<a href="#not28" class="noteref">28</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">163.</span> The gods laid one buckskin on the ground with the head to the west; on this they
placed the two ears of corn, with their tips to the east, and over the corn they spread
the other buckskin with its head to the east; under the white ear they put the feather
of a white eagle, under the yellow ear the feather of a yellow eagle. Then they told
the people to stand at a distance and allow the wind to enter. The white wind blew
from the east, and the yellow wind blew from the west, between the skins. While the
wind was blowing, eight of the Mirage People came and walked around the objects on
the ground four times, and as they walked the eagle feathers, whose tips protruded
from between the buckskins, were seen to move. When the Mirage People had finished
their walk the upper buckskin was lifted,&#x2014;the ears of corn had disappeared; a man
and a woman lay there in their stead.
</p>
<p id="par164"><span class="parNum">164.</span> The white ear of corn had been changed into a man, the yellow ear into a woman. It
was the wind that gave them life. It is the wind that comes out of our mouths now
that gives us life. When this ceases to blow we die. In the skin at the tips of our
fingers we see the trail of the wind; it shows us where the wind blew when our ancestors
were created.
</p>
<p id="par165"><span class="parNum">165.</span> The pair thus created were First Man and First Woman (Atsé <i>H</i>astí<i>n</i> and Atsé Estsán). The gods directed the people to build an <span class="corr" id="xd29e4383" title="Source: inclosure">enclosure</span> of brushwood for the pair. When the <span class="corr" id="xd29e4386" title="Source: inclosure">enclosure</span> was finished, First Man and First Woman entered it, and the gods said to them: &#x201c;Live
together now as husband and wife.&#x201d; At the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>end of four days hermaphrodite<a href="#not29" class="noteref">29</a> twins were born, and at the end of four days more a boy and a girl were born, who
in four days grew to maturity and lived with one another as husband and wife. The
primal pair had in all five pairs of twins, the first of which only was barren, being
hermaphrodites.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">166.</span> In four days after the last pair of twins was born, the gods came again and took
First Man and First Woman away to the eastern mountain where the gods dwelt, and kept
them there for four days. When they returned all their children were taken to the
eastern mountain and kept there for four days. Soon after they all returned it was
observed that they occasionally wore masks, such as <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an wear now, and that when they wore these masks they prayed for all good things,&#x2014;for
abundant rain and abundant crops. It is thought, too, that during their visit to the
eastern mountain they learned the awful secrets of witchcraft, for the antíhi (witches,
wizards) always keep such masks with them and marry those too nearly related to them.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">167.</span> When they returned from the eastern mountain the brothers and sisters separated;
and, keeping the fact of their former unlawful marriages secret, the brothers married
women of the Mirage People and the sisters married men of the Mirage People. They
kept secret, too, all the mysteries they had learned in the eastern mountain. The
women thus married bore children every four days, and the children grew to maturity
in four days, were married, and in their turn had children every four days. This numerous
offspring married among the Kisáni, and among those who had come from the lower world,
and soon there was a multitude of people in the land.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">168.</span> These descendants of First Man and First Woman made a great farm. They built a dam
and dug a wide irrigating ditch. But they feared the Kisáni might injure their dam
or their crops; so they put one of the hermaphrodites to watch the dam and the other
to watch the lower end of the field. The hermaphrodite who watched at the dam invented
pottery. He made first a plate, a bowl, and a dipper, which were greatly admired by
the people. The hermaphrodite who lived at the lower end of the farm invented the
wicker water-bottle.<a href="#not30" class="noteref">30</a> Others made, from thin split boards of cottonwood, implements which they shoved before
them to clear the weeds out of the land. They made also hoes from shoulder-blades
of deer and axes of stone. They got their seeds from the Kisáni.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">169.</span> Once they killed a little deer, and some one among them thought that perhaps they
might make, from the skin of the head, a mask, by means of which they could approach
other deer and kill them. They tried to make such a mask but failed; they could not
make it fit. They debated over the invention and considered it for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>four days, but did not succeed. On the morning of the fifth day they heard the gods
shouting in the distance. As on a previous occasion, they shouted four times, and
after the fourth call they made their appearance. They brought with them heads of
deer and of antelope. They showed the people how the masks were made and fitted, how
the eye-holes were cut, how the motions of the deer were to be imitated, and explained
to them all the other mysteries of the deer-hunt.<a href="#not31" class="noteref">31</a> Next day hunters went out and several deer were killed; from these more masks were
made, and with these masks more men went out to hunt; after that time the camp had
abundance of meat. The people dressed the deerskins and made garments out of them.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">170.</span> The people from the third world had been in the fourth world eight years when the
following incident occurred: One day they saw the sky stooping down and the earth
rising up to meet it. For a moment they came in contact, and then there sprang out
of the earth, at the point of contact, the Coyote and the Badger. We think now that
the Coyote and the Badger are children of the sky. The Coyote rose first, and for
this reason we think he is the elder brother of the Badger. At once the Coyote came
over to the camp and skulked round among the people, while the Badger went down into
the hole that led to the lower world.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">171.</span> First Man told the people the names of the four mountains which rose in the distance.
They were named the same as the four mountains that now bound the Navaho land. There
was Ts&#x12d;snad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni in the east, Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> in the south, <i>D</i>okoslí<i>d</i> in the west, and <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa in the north, and he told them that a different race of people lived in each
mountain.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">172.</span> First Man was the chief of all these people in the fourth world, except the Kisáni.
He was a great hunter, and his wife, First Woman, was very corpulent. One day he brought
home from the hunt a fine fat deer. The woman boiled some of it and they had a hearty
meal. When they were done the woman wiped her greasy hands on her dress, and made
a remark which greatly enraged her husband; they had a quarrel about this, which First
Man ended by jumping across the fire and remaining by himself in silence for the rest
of the night.<a href="#not32" class="noteref">32</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">173.</span> Next morning First Man went out early and called aloud to the people: &#x201c;Come hither,
all ye men,&#x201d; he said; &#x201c;I wish to speak to you, but let all the women stay behind;
I do not wish to see them.&#x201d; Soon all the males gathered, and he told them what his
wife had said the night before. &#x201c;They believe,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that they can live without
us. Let us see if they can hunt game and till the fields without our help. Let us
see what sort of a living they can make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>by themselves. Let us leave them and persuade the Kisáni to come with us. We will
cross the stream, and when we are gone over we will keep the raft on the other side.&#x201d;
He sent for the hermaphrodites. They came, covered with meal, for they had been grinding
corn. &#x201c;What have you that you have made yourselves?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;We have each two mealing-stones,
and we have cups and bowls and baskets and many other things,&#x201d; they answered. &#x201c;Then
take these all along with you,&#x201d; he ordered, &#x201c;and join us to cross the stream.&#x201d; Then
all the men and the hermaphrodites assembled at the river and crossed to the north
side on the raft, and they took over with them their stone axes and farm implements
and everything they had made. When they had all crossed they sent the raft down to
the Kisáni for them to cross. The latter came over,&#x2014;six gentes of them,&#x2014;but they took
their women with them. While some of the young men were crossing the stream they cried
at parting with their wives; still they went at the bidding of their chief. The men
left the women everything the latter had helped to make or raise.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">174.</span> As soon as they had crossed the river some of the men went out hunting, for the young
boys needed food, and some set to work to chop down willows and build huts. They had
themselves all sheltered in four days.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">175.</span> That winter the women had abundance of food, and they feasted, sang, and had a merry
time. They often came down to the bank of the river and called across to the men and
taunted and reviled them. Next year the men prepared a few small fields and raised
a little corn; but they did not have much corn to eat, and lived a good deal by hunting.
The women planted all of the old farm, but they did not work it very well; so in the
winter they had a small crop, and they did not sing and make merry as in the previous
winter. In the second spring the women planted less, while the men planted more, cleared
more land, and increased the size of their farm. Each year the fields and crops of
the men increased, while those of the women diminished and they began to suffer for
want of food. Some went out and gathered the seeds of wild plants to eat. In the autumn
of the third year of separation many women jumped into the river and tried to swim
over; but they were carried under the surface of the water and were never seen again.
In the fourth year the men had more food than they could eat; corn and pumpkins lay
untouched in the fields, while the women were starving.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">176.</span> First Man at length began to think what the effect of his course might be. He saw
that if he continued to keep the men and the women apart the race might die out, so
he called the men and spoke his thoughts to them. Some said, &#x201c;Surely our race will
perish,&#x201d; and others said, &#x201c;What good is our abundance to us? We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>think so much of our poor women starving in our sight that we cannot eat.&#x201d; Then he
sent a man to the shore to call across the stream to find if First Woman were still
there, and to bid her come down to the bank if she were. She came to the bank, and
First Man called to her and asked if she still thought she could live alone. &#x201c;No,&#x201d;
she replied, &#x201c;we cannot live without our husbands.&#x201d; The men and the women were then
told to assemble at the shores of the stream; the raft was sent over and the women
were ferried across. They were made to bathe their bodies and dry them with meal.
They were put in a corral and kept there until night, when they were let out to join
the men in their feasts.<a href="#not33" class="noteref">33</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">177.</span> When they were let out of the corral it was found that three were missing. After
dark, voices were heard calling from the other side of the river; they were the voices
of the missing ones,&#x2014;a mother and her two daughters. They begged to be ferried over,
but the men told them it was too dark, that they must wait until morning. Hearing
this, they jumped into the stream and tried to swim over. The mother succeeded in
reaching the opposite bank and finding her husband. The daughters were seized by Tiéholtsodi,
the water monster, and dragged down under the water.
</p>
<p id="par178"><span class="parNum">178.</span> For three nights and three days the people heard nothing about the young women and
supposed them lost forever. On the morning of the fourth day the call of the gods
was heard,&#x2014;four times as usual,&#x2014;and after the fourth call White Body made his appearance,
holding up two fingers and pointing to the river. The people supposed that these signs
had reference to the lost girls. Some of the men crossed the stream on the raft and
looked for the tracks of the lost ones; they traced the tracks to the edge of the
water, but no farther. White Body went away, but soon returned, accompanied by Blue
Body. White Body carried a large bowl of white shell, and Blue Body a large bowl of
blue shell. They asked for a man and a woman to accompany them, and they went down
to the river. They put both the bowls on the surface of the water and caused them
to spin around. Beneath the spinning bowls the water opened, for it was hollow, and
gave entrance to a large house of four rooms. The room in the east was made of the
dark waters, the room in the south of the blue waters, the room in the west of the
yellow waters, and the room in the north of waters of all colors.<a href="#not36" class="noteref">36</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">179.</span> The man and the woman descended and Coyote followed them. They went first into the
east room, but there they found nothing; then they went into the south room, but there
they found nothing; next they went into the west room, where again they found nothing;
at last they went into the north room, and there they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>beheld the water monster Tiéholtsodi, with the two girls he had stolen and two children
of his own. The man and the woman demanded the children, and as he said nothing in
reply they took them and walked away. But as they went out Coyote, unperceived by
all, took the two children of Tiéholtsodi and carried them off under his robe. Coyote
always wore his robe folded close around him and always slept with it thus folded,
so no one was surprised to see that he still wore his robe in this way when he came
up from the waters, and no one suspected that he had stolen the children of Tiéholtsodi.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">180.</span> Next day the people were surprised to see deer, turkey, and antelope running past
from east to west, and to see animals of six different kinds (two kinds of Hawks,
two kinds of Squirrels, the Hummingbird, and the Bat) come into their camp as if for
refuge. The game animals ran past in increasing numbers during the three days following.
On the morning of the fourth day, when the white light rose, the people observed in
the east a strange white gleam along the horizon, and they sent out the Locust couriers
to see what caused this unusual appearance. The Locusts returned before sunset, and
told the people that a vast flood of waters was fast approaching from the east. On
hearing this the people all assembled together, the Kisáni with the others, in a great
multitude, and they wailed and wept over the approaching catastrophe. They wept and
moaned all night and could not sleep.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">181.</span> When the white light arose in the east, next morning, the waters were seen high as
mountains encircling the whole horizon, except in the west, and rolling on rapidly.
The people packed up all their goods as fast as they could, and ran up on a high hill
near by, for temporary safety. Here they held a council. Some one suggested that perhaps
the two Squirrels (<i>H</i>azáitso and <i>H</i>azáistozi) might help them. &#x201c;We will try what we can do,&#x201d; said the Squirrels. One
planted a piñon seed, the other a juniper seed, and they grew so very fast that the
people hoped that they would soon grow so tall that the flood could not reach their
tops, and that all might find shelter there. But after the trees grew a little way
they began to branch out and grew no higher. Then the frightened people called on
the Weasels (Glo&#x2bb;ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>kái and Glo&#x2bb;ds&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni). One of these planted a spruce seed and one a pine seed. The trees sprouted
at once and grew fast, and again the people began to hope; but soon the trees commenced
to branch, and they dwindled to slender points at the top and ceased to grow higher.
Now they were in the depths of despair, for the waters were coming nearer every moment,
when they saw two men approaching the hill on which they were gathered.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">182.</span> One of the approaching men was old and grayhaired; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>other, who was young, walked in advance. They ascended the hill and passed through
the crowd, speaking to no one. The young man sat down on the summit, the old man sat
down behind him, and the Locust sat down behind the old man,&#x2014;all facing the east.
The elder took out seven bags from under his robe and opened them. Each contained
a small quantity of earth. He told the people that in these bags he had earth from
the seven sacred mountains. There were in the fourth world seven sacred mountains,
named and placed like the sacred mountains of the present Navaho land. &#x201c;Ah! Perhaps
our father can do something for us,&#x201d; said the people. &#x201c;I cannot, but my son may be
able to help you,&#x201d; said the old man. Then they bade the son to help them, and he said
he would if they all moved away from where he stood, faced to the west, and looked
not around until he called them; for no one should see him at his work. They did as
he desired, and in a few moments he called them to come to him. When they came, they
saw that he had spread the sacred earth on the ground and planted in it thirty-two
reeds, each of which had thirty-two joints. As they gazed they beheld the roots of
the reeds striking out into the soil and growing rapidly downward. A moment later
all the reeds joined together and became one reed of great size, with a hole in its
eastern side. He bade them enter the hollow of the reed through this hole. When they
were all safely inside, the opening closed, and none too soon, for scarcely had it
closed when they heard the loud noise of the surging waters outside, saying, &#x201c;Yi<i>n</i>, yi<i>n</i>, yi<i>n</i>.&#x201d;<a href="#not37" class="noteref">37</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">183.</span> The waters rose fast, but the reed grew faster, and soon it grew so high that it
began to sway, and the people inside were in great fear lest, with their weight, it
might break and topple over into the water. White Body, Blue Body, and Black Body
were along. Black Body blew a great breath out through a hole in the top of the reed;
a heavy dark cloud formed around the reed and kept it steady. But the reed grew higher
and higher; again it began to sway, and again the people within were in great fear,
whereat he blew and made another cloud to steady the reed. By sunset it had grown
up close to the sky, but it swayed and waved so much that they could not secure it
to the sky until Black Body, who was uppermost, took the plume out of his head-band
and stuck it out through the top of the cane against the sky, and this is why the
reed (<i lang="la">Phragmites communis</i>) always carries a plume on its head now.<a href="#not38" class="noteref">38</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">184.</span> Seeing no hole in the sky, they sent up the Great Hawk, Gin&#x12d;&#x2032;tso, to see what he
could do. He flew up and began to scratch in the sky with his claws, and he scratched
and scratched till he was lost to sight. After a while he came back, and said that
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>scratched to where he could see light, but that he did not get through the sky. Next
they sent up a Locust.<a href="#not39" class="noteref">39</a> He was gone a long time, and when he came back he had this story to tell: He had
gotten through to the upper world, and came out on a little island in the centre of
a lake. When he got out he saw approaching him from the east a black Grebe, and from
the west a yellow Grebe.<a href="#not40" class="noteref">40</a> One of them said to him: &#x201c;Who are you and whence come you?&#x201d; But he made no reply.
The other then said: &#x201c;We own half of this world,&#x2014;I in the east, my brother in the
west. We give you a challenge. If you can do as we do, we shall give you one half
of the world; if you cannot, you must die.&#x201d; Each had an arrow made of the black wind.
He passed the arrow from side to side through his heart and flung it down to Won&#x12d;st<i>s</i>í<i>d</i>i, the Locust.<a href="#not41" class="noteref">41</a> The latter picked up one of the arrows, ran it from side to side through his heart,
as he had seen the Grebes do, and threw it down.<a href="#not42" class="noteref">42</a> The Grebes swam away, one to the east and one to the west, and troubled him no more.
When they had gone, two more Grebes appeared, a blue one from the south and a shining
one from the north. They spoke to him as the other Grebes had spoken, and gave him
the same challenge. Again he passed the arrow through his heart and the Grebes departed,
leaving the land to the locust. To this day we see in every locust&#x2019;s sides the holes
made by the arrows. But the hole the Locust made in ascending was too small for many
of the people, so they sent Badger up to make it larger. When Badger came back his
legs were stained black with the mud, and the legs of all badgers have been black
ever since. Then First Man and First Woman led the way and all the others followed
them, and they climbed up through the hole to the surface of this&#x2014;the fifth&#x2014;world.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">II.</span> EARLY EVENTS IN THE FIFTH WORLD.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">185.</span> The lake<a href="#not43" class="noteref">43</a> was bounded by high cliffs, from the top of which stretched a great plain. There
are mountains around it now, but these have been created since the time of the emergence.
Finding no way to get out of the lake, they called on Blue Body to help them. He had
brought with him from the lower world four stones; he threw one of these towards each
of the four cardinal points against the cliffs, breaking holes, through which the
waters flowed away in four different directions.<a href="#not44" class="noteref">44</a> The lake did not altogether drain out by this means; but the bottom became bare in
one place, connecting the island with the mainland. But the mud was so deep in this
place that they still hesitated to cross, and they prayed to N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i <i>D</i>&#x12d;lkóhi, Smooth Wind, to come to their aid.<a href="#not45" class="noteref">45</a> N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i <i>D</i>&#x12d;lkóhi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>blew a strong wind, and in one day dried up the mud so that the people could easily
walk over. While they were waiting for the ground to dry, the Kisáni camped on the
east side of the island and built a stone wall (which stands to this day), to lean
against and to shelter them from the wind.<a href="#not46" class="noteref">46</a> The other people set up a shelter of brushwood. The women erected four poles, on
which they stretched a deerskin, and under the shelter of this they played the game
of three-sticks,<a href="#not47" class="noteref">47</a> ts&#x12d;n<i>d</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;, one of the four games which they brought with them from the lower world.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">186.</span> When they reached the mainland they sought to divine their fate. To do this some
one threw a hide-scraper into the water, saying: &#x201c;If it sinks we perish, if it floats
we live.&#x201d; It floated, and all rejoiced. But Coyote said: &#x201c;Let me divine your fate.&#x201d;
He picked up a stone, and saying, &#x201c;If it sinks we perish; if it floats we live,&#x201d; he
threw it into the water. It sank, of course, and all were angry with him and reviled
him; but he answered them saying: &#x201c;If we all live, and continue to increase as we
have done, the earth will soon be too small to hold us, and there will be no room
for the cornfields. It is better that each of us should live but a time on this earth
and then leave and make room for our children.&#x201d; They saw the wisdom of his words and
were silent. The day they arrived at the shore they had two visitors,&#x2014;Puma and Wolf.
&#x201c;We have heard,&#x201d; said these, &#x201c;that some new people had come up out of the ground,
and we have come over to see them.&#x201d; Puma took a bride from among the new people.
</p>
<p id="par187"><span class="parNum">187.</span> On the fourth day of the emergence some one went to look at the hole through which
they had come out, and he noticed water welling up there; already it was nearly on
a level with the top of the hole, and every moment it rose higher. In haste he ran
back to his people and told them what he had seen. A council was called at once to
consider the new danger that threatened them. First Man, who rose to speak, said,
pointing to Coyote: &#x201c;Yonder is a rascal, and there is something wrong about him. He
never takes off his robe, even when he lies down. I have watched him for a long time,
and have suspected that he carries some stolen property under his robe. Let us search
him.&#x201d;<a href="#not48" class="noteref">48</a> They tore the robe from Coyote&#x2019;s shoulders, and two strange little objects dropped
out that looked something like buffalo calves, but were spotted all over in various
colors; they were the young of Tiéholtsodi. At once the people threw them into the
hole through which the waters were pouring; in an instant the waters subsided, and
rushed away with a deafening noise to the lower world.<a href="#not49" class="noteref">49</a>
</p>
<p id="par188"><span class="parNum">188.</span> On the fifth night one of the twin hermaphrodites ceased to breathe. They left her
alone all that night, and, when morning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>came, Coyote proposed to lay her at rest among the rocks. This they did; but they
all wondered what had become of her breath. They went in various directions to seek
for its trail, but could find it nowhere. While they were hunting, two men went near
the hole through which they had come from the lower world. It occurred to one of them
to look down into the hole. He did so, and he saw the dead one seated by the side
of the river, in the fourth world, combing her hair. He called to his companion and
the latter came and looked down, too. They returned to their people and related what
they had seen; but in four days both these men died, and ever since the Navahoes have
feared to look upon the dead, or to behold a ghost, lest they die themselves.<a href="#not60" class="noteref">60</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">189.</span> After this it was told around that the Kisáni, who were in camp at a little distance
from the others, had brought with them from the lower world an ear of corn for seed.
Some of the unruly ones proposed to go to the camp of the Kisáni and take the corn
away from them; but others, of better counsel, said that this would be wrong, that
the Kisáni had had as much trouble as the rest, and if they had more foresight they
had a right to profit by it. In spite of these words, some of the young men went and
demanded the corn of the Kisáni. The latter said, after some angry talk on both sides,
&#x201c;We will break the ear in two and give you whichever half you choose.&#x201d; The young men
agreed to this bargain, and the woman who owned the ear broke it in the middle and
laid the pieces down for the others to choose. The young men looked at the pieces,
and were considering which they would take, when Coyote, getting impatient, picked
up the tip end of the ear and made off with it. The Kisáni kept the butt, and this
is the reason the Pueblo Indians have to-day better crops of corn than the Navahoes.
But the Pueblos had become alarmed at the threats and angry language of their neighbors
and moved away from them, and this is why the Navahoes and Pueblos now live apart
from one another.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">190.</span> After the Kisáni moved away, First Man and First Woman, Black Body and Blue Body,
set out to build the seven sacred mountains of the present Navaho land. They made
them all of earth which they had brought from similar mountains in the fourth world.
The mountains they made were Ts&#x12d;snad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni in the east, Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> (Taylor, San Mateo) in the south, <i>D</i>okoslí<i>d</i> (San Francisco) in the west, <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa (San Juan) in the north, with Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>, T<i>s</i>olíhi, and Ak&#x12d;<i>d</i>anas<i>t</i>áni (Hosta Butte) in the middle of the land.<a href="#not61" class="noteref">61</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">191.</span> Through Ts&#x12d;snad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni,<a href="#not62" class="noteref">62</a> in the east, they ran a bolt of lightning to fasten it to the earth. They decorated
it with white shells, white lightning, white corn, dark clouds, and he-rain. They
set a big dish or bowl of shell on its summit, and in it they put two eggs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>of the Pigeon to make feathers for the mountain. The eggs they covered with a sacred
buckskin to make them hatch (there are many wild pigeons in this mountain now). All
these things they covered with a sheet of daylight, and they put the Rock Crystal
Boy and the Rock Crystal Girl<a href="#not53" class="noteref">53</a> into the mountain to dwell.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">192.</span> Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i>,<a href="#not54" class="noteref">54</a> the mountain of the south, they fastened to the earth with a great stone knife, thrust
through from top to bottom. They adorned it with turquoise, with dark mist, she-rain,
and all different kinds of wild animals. On its summit they placed a dish of turquoise;
in this they put two eggs of the Bluebird, which they covered with sacred buckskin
(there are many bluebirds in Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> now), and over all they spread a covering of blue sky. The Boy who Carries One Turquoise
and the Girl who Carries One Grain of Corn<a href="#not55" class="noteref">55</a> were put into the mountain to dwell.
</p>
<p id="par193"><span class="parNum">193.</span> <i>D</i>okoslí<i>d</i>,<a href="#not56" class="noteref">56</a> the mountain of the west, they fastened to the earth with a sunbeam. They adorned
it with haliotis shell, with black clouds, he-rain, yellow corn, and all sorts of
wild animals. They placed a dish of haliotis shell on the top, and laid in this two
eggs of the Yellow Warbler, covering them with sacred buckskins. There are many yellow
warblers now in <i>D</i>okoslí<i>d</i>. Over all they spread a yellow cloud, and they sent White Corn Boy and Yellow Corn
Girl<a href="#not57" class="noteref">57</a> to dwell there.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">194.</span> <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa, the mountain in the north, they fastened with a rainbow. They adorned it
with black beads (pás<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni), with the dark mist, with different kinds of plants, and many kinds of wild animals.
On its top they put a dish of pás<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni; in this they placed two eggs of the Blackbird, over which they laid a sacred
buckskin. Over all they spread a covering of darkness. Lastly they put the Pollen
Boy and Grasshopper Girl<a href="#not59" class="noteref">59</a> in the mountain, to dwell there.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">195.</span> Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>,<a href="#not60" class="noteref">60</a> was fastened with a sunbeam. They decorated it with goods of all kinds, with the
dark cloud, and the male rain. They put nothing on top of it; they left its summit
free, in order that warriors might fight there; but they put Boy Who Produces Goods
and Girl Who Produces Goods<a href="#not61" class="noteref">61</a> there to live.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">196.</span> The mountain of T<i>s</i>olíhi<a href="#not62" class="noteref">62</a> they fastened to the earth with n&#x12d;&#x2032;ltsatlo<i>l</i> (the streak or cord of rain). They decorated it with pollen, the dark mist, and the
female rain. They placed on top of it a live bird named T<i>s</i>o<i>z</i>gá<i>l</i>i,<a href="#not68" class="noteref">68</a>&#x2014;such birds abound there now,&#x2014;and they put in the mountain to dwell Boy Who Produces
Jewels and Girl Who Produces Jewels.<a href="#not64" class="noteref">64</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">197.</span> The mountain of Ak&#x12d;<i>d</i>anas<i>t</i>áni<a href="#not66" class="noteref">66</a> they fastened to the earth with a sacred stone called tse&#x2bb;<i>h</i>a<i>d</i>á<i>h</i>onige, or mirage-stone. They decorated it with black clouds, the he-rain, and all
sorts of plants. They placed a live Grasshopper on its summit, and they put the Mirage-stone
Boy and the Carnelian Girl there to dwell.<a href="#not66" class="noteref">66</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">198.</span> They still had the three lights and the darkness, as in the lower worlds. But First
Man and First Woman thought they might form some lights which would make the world
brighter. After much study and debate they planned to make the sun and moon. For the
sun they made a round flat object, like a dish, out of a clear stone called tsé&#x2bb;tsagi.
They set turquoises around the edge, and outside of these they put rays of red rain,
lightning, and snakes of many kinds. At first they thought of putting four points
on it, as they afterwards did on the stars, but they changed their minds and made
it round. They made the moon of tsé&#x2bb;tson (star-rock, a kind of crystal); they bordered
it with white shells and they put on its face <i>h</i>a<i>d</i>&#x12d;lk&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>s</i> (sheet lightning), and <i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>l</i>anast<i>s</i>i (all kinds of water).<a href="#not67" class="noteref">67</a>
</p>
<p id="par199"><span class="parNum">199.</span> Then they counseled as to what they should do with the sun; where they should make
it rise first. The Wind of the East begged that it might be brought to his land, so
they dragged it off to the edge of the world where he dwelt; there they gave it to
the man who planted the great cane in the lower world, and appointed him to carry
it. To an old gray-haired man, who had joined them in the lower world, the moon was
given to carry. These men had no names before, but now the former received the name
of T<i>s</i>óhanoai, or T<i>s</i>í<i>n</i>hanoai, and the latter the name of Kléhanoai. When they were about to depart, in order
to begin their labors, the people were sorry, for they were beloved by all. But First
Man said to the sorrowing people: &#x201c;Mourn not for them, for you will see them in the
heavens, and all that die will be theirs in return for their labors.<span class="corr" id="xd29e4826" title="Not in source">&#x201d;</span><a href="#not68" class="noteref">68</a> (See notes <a href="#not69">69</a> and <a href="#not70">70</a> for additions to the legend.)
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">200.</span> Then the people (<i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb;, Navahoes) began to travel. They journeyed towards the east, and after one day&#x2019;s
march they reached Ni<i>h</i>a<i>h</i>okaí (White Spot on the Earth) and camped for the night. Here a woman brought forth,
but her offspring was not like a child; it was round, misshapen, and had no head.
The people counselled, and determined that it should be thrown into a gully. So they
threw it away; but it lived and grew up and became the monster <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>,<a href="#not131" class="noteref">131</a> who afterwards destroyed so many of the people.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">201.</span> Next day they wandered farther to the east, and camped at night at Tse&#x2bb;<i>t</i>aiská (Rock Bending Back). Here was born another misshapen creature, which had something
like feathers on both its shoulders. It looked like nothing that was ever seen before,
so the people concluded to throw this away also. They took it to an alkali bed close
by and cast it away there. But it lived and grew and became the terrible Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale,<a href="#not135" class="noteref">135</a> of whom I shall have much to tell later.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">202.</span> The next night, travelling still to the east, they camped at Tse&#x2bb;biná<i>h</i>otyel, a broad high cliff like a wall, and here a woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>bore another strange creature. It had no head, but had a long pointed end where the
head ought to be. This object was deposited in the cliff, in a hole which was afterwards
sealed up with a stone. They left it there to die, but it grew up and became the destroyer
Tse&#x2bb;<i>t</i>a<i>h</i>ot<i>s</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;<i>l</i>i,<a href="#not142" class="noteref">142</a> of whom we shall tell hereafter. Because he was closed into the rock, his hair grew
into it and he could not fall.
</p>
<p id="par203"><span class="parNum">203.</span> The next night, when they stopped at Tse&#x2bb;a<i>h</i>al<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni (Rock with Black Hole), twins were born. They were both roundish with one end
tapering to a point. There were no signs of limbs or head, but there were depressions
which had somewhat the appearance of eyes. The people laid them on the ground, and
next day, when they moved camp, abandoned them. Tse&#x2bb;a<i>h</i>al<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni is shaped like a Navaho hut, with a door in the east. It is supposed that, when
they were abandoned to die, the twin monsters went into this natural hut to dwell.
They grew up, however, and became the B&#x12d;náye A<i>h</i>áni, who slew with their eyes, and of whom we shall have more to tell.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">204.</span> All these monsters were the fruit of the transgressions of the women in the fourth
world, when they were separated from the men. Other monsters were born on the march,
and others, again, sprang from the blood which had been shed during the birth of the
first monsters,<a href="#not71" class="noteref">71</a> and all these grew up to become enemies and destroyers of the people.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">205.</span> When they left Tse&#x2bb;a<i>h</i>al<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni they turned toward the west, and journeyed until they came to a place called
<i>T</i>o&#x2bb;&#x12d;ntsósoko (Water in a Narrow Gully), and here they remained for thirteen years,
making farms and planting corn, beans, and pumpkins every spring.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">206.</span> In those days the four-footed beasts, the birds, and the snakes were people also,
like ourselves, and built houses and lived near our people close to <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa. They increased and became the cliff-dwellers. It must have been the flying
creatures who built the dwellings high on the cliffs, for if they had not wings how
could they reach their houses?
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">207.</span> From <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;&#x12d;ntsósoko they moved to Tse&#x2bb;<i>l</i>akaíia (Standing White Rock), and here they sojourned again for thirteen years. From
the latter place they moved to Tse&#x2bb;pa<i>h</i>alkaí (White on Face of Cliff), and here, once more, they remained for a period of
thirteen years. During this time the monsters began to devour the people.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">208.</span> From Tse&#x2bb;pa<i>h</i>alkaí they moved to the neighborhood of K&#x12d;ntyél<a href="#not72" class="noteref">72</a> (Broad House), in the Chaco Canyon, where the ruins of the great pueblo still stand.
When the wanderers arrived the pueblo was in process of building, but was not finished.
The way it came to be built you shall now hear:&#x2014;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">209.</span> Some time before, there had descended among the Pueblos, from the heavens, a divine
gambler, or gambling-god, named No<i>h</i>oílpi, or He Who Wins Men (at play); his talisman was a great piece of turquoise.
When he came he challenged the people to all sorts of games and contests, and in all
of these he was successful. He won from them, first, their property, then their women
and children, and finally some of the men themselves. Then he told them he would give
them part of their property back in payment if they would build a great house; so
when the Navahoes came, the Pueblos were busy building in order that they might release
their enthralled relatives and their property. They were also busy making a race-track,
and preparing for all kinds of games of chance and skill.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">210.</span> When all was ready, and four days&#x2019; notice had been given, twelve men came from the
neighboring pueblo of K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i>, Blue House, to compete with the great gambler. They bet their own persons, and after
a brief contest they lost themselves to No<i>h</i>oílpi. Again a notice of four days was given, and again twelve men of K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i>&#x2014;relatives of the former twelve&#x2014;came to play, and these also lost themselves. For
the third time an announcement, four days in advance of a game, was given; this time
some women were among the twelve contestants, and they, too, lost themselves. All
were put to work on the building of K&#x12d;ntyél as soon as they forfeited their liberty.
At the end of another four days the children of these men and women came to try to
win back their parents, but they succeeded only in adding themselves to the number
of the gambler&#x2019;s slaves. On a fifth trial, after four days&#x2019; warning, twelve leading
men of Blue House were lost, among them the chief of the pueblo. On a sixth duly announced
gambling day, twelve more men, all important persons, staked their liberty and lost
it. Up to this time the Navahoes had kept count of the winnings of No<i>h</i>oílpi, but afterwards people from other pueblos came in such numbers to play and lose
that they could keep count no longer. In addition to their own persons the later victims
brought in beads, shells, turquoise, and all sorts of valuables, and gambled them
away. With the labor of all these slaves it was not long until the great K&#x12d;ntyél was
finished.
</p>
<p id="par211"><span class="parNum">211.</span> But all this time the Navahoes had been merely spectators, and had taken no part
in the games. One day the voice of the beneficent god, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i,<a href="#not73" class="noteref">73</a> was heard faintly in the distance crying his usual call, &#x201c;Wu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hú.&#x201d; His voice
was heard, as it is always heard, four times, each time nearer and nearer, and immediately
after the last call, which was loud and clear, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i appeared at the door of a hut where dwelt a young couple who had no children, and
with them he communicated by means of signs. He told them that the people of <span class="corr" id="xd29e4991" title="Source: K&#x12d;&#x2032;ndotl&#x12d;z">K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i></span> had lost at game with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>No<i>h</i>oílpi two great shells, the greatest treasures of the pueblo; that the Sun had coveted
these shells and had begged them from the gambler; that the latter had refused the
request of the Sun and the Sun was angry. In consequence of all this, as <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i related, in twelve days from his visit certain divine personages would meet in the
mountains, in a place which he designated, to hold a great ceremony. He invited the
young man to be present at the ceremony and disappeared.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">212.</span> The Navaho kept count of the passing days; on the twelfth day he repaired to the
appointed place, and there he found a great assemblage of the gods. There were <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, <span class="corr" id="xd29e5026" title="Source: Hastséhogan"><i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an</span><a href="#not74" class="noteref">74</a> and his son, N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i<a href="#not75" class="noteref">75</a> (Wind), T<i>s</i>a<i>l</i>yé<i>l</i> (Darkness), T<i>s</i>ápani (Bat), <i>L</i>&#x12d;stsó (Great Snake), Ts&#x12d;lká<i>l</i>i (a little bird), Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi (Gopher), and many others. Besides these there were present
a number of pets or domesticated animals belonging to the gambler, who were dissatisfied
with their lot, were anxious to be free, and would gladly obtain their share of the
spoils in case their master was ruined. N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i (Wind) had spoken to them, and they had come to enter into the plot against No<i>h</i>oílpi. All night the gods danced and sang and performed their mystic rites for the
purpose of giving to the son of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an powers, as a gambler, equal to those of No<i>h</i>oílpi. When the morning came they washed the young neophyte all over, dried him with
meal, dressed him in clothes exactly like those the gambler wore, and in every way
made him look as much like the gambler as possible, and then they counselled as to
what other means they should take to outwit No<i>h</i>oílpi.
</p>
<p id="par213"><span class="parNum">213.</span> In the first place, they desired to find out how he felt about having refused to
his father, the Sun, the two great shells. &#x201c;I will do this,&#x201d; said N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i (Wind), &#x201c;for I can penetrate everywhere, and no one can see me;&#x201d; but the others
said: &#x201c;No; you can go everywhere, but you cannot travel without making a noise and
disturbing people. Let T<i>s</i>a<i>l</i>yé<i>l</i> (Darkness) go on this errand, for he also goes wherever he wills, yet he makes no
noise.&#x201d; So T<i>s</i>a<i>l</i>yé<i>l</i> went to the gambler&#x2019;s house, entered his room, went all through his body while he
slept, and searched well his mind, and he came back saying, &#x201c;No<i>h</i>oílpi is sorry for what he has done.&#x201d; N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i, however, did not believe this; so, although his services had been before refused,
he repaired to the chamber where the gambler slept, and went all through his body
and searched well his mind; but he, too, came back saying No<i>h</i>oílpi was sorry that he had refused to give the great shells to his father.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">214.</span> One of the games they proposed to play is called <i>t</i>aká-<i>t</i>had-sáta, or the thirteen chips. (It is played with thirteen thin flat pieces of wood,
which are colored red on one side and left white or uncolored <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>on the other side. Success depends on the number of chips which, being thrown upwards,
fall with their white sides up.) &#x201c;Leave the game to me,&#x201d; said the Bat; &#x201c;I have made
thirteen chips that are white on both sides. I will hide myself in the ceiling, and
when our champion throws up his chips I will grasp them and throw down my chips instead.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">215.</span> Another game they were to play is called nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i>.<a href="#not76" class="noteref">76</a> (It is played with two long sticks or poles, of peculiar shape and construction,
one marked with red and the other with black, and a single hoop. A long, many-tailed
string, called the &#x201c;turkey-claw,&#x201d; is secured to the end of each pole.) &#x201c;Leave nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i> to me,&#x201d; said Great Snake; &#x201c;I will hide myself in the hoop and make it fall where
I please.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">216.</span> Another game was one called ts&#x12d;&#x2032;nbetsi<i>l</i>, or push-on-the-wood. (In this the contestants push against a tree until it is torn
from its roots and falls.) &#x201c;I will see that this game is won,&#x201d; said Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi, the Gopher;
&#x201c;I will gnaw the roots of the tree, so that he who shoves it may easily make it fall.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">217.</span> In the game t<i>s</i>ol, or ball, the object was to hit the ball so that it would fall beyond a certain
line. &#x201c;I will win this game for you,&#x201d; said the little bird Ts&#x12d;lká<i>l</i>i, &#x201c;for I will hide within the ball, and fly with it wherever I want to go. Do not
hit the ball hard; give it only a light tap, and depend on me to carry it.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">218.</span> The pets of the gambler begged the Wind to blow hard, so that they might have an
excuse to give their master for not keeping due watch when he was in danger, and in
the morning the Wind blew for them a strong gale. At dawn the whole party of conspirators
left the mountain, and came down to the brow of the canyon to watch until sunrise.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">219.</span> No<i>h</i>oílpi had two wives, who were the prettiest women in the whole land. Wherever she
went, each carried in her hand a stick with something tied on the end of it, as a
sign that she was the wife of the great gambler.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">220.</span> It was their custom for one of them to go every morning at sunrise to a neighboring
spring to get water. So at sunrise the watchers on the brow of the cliff saw one of
the wives coming out of the gambler&#x2019;s house with a water-jar on her head, whereupon
the son of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an descended into the canyon and followed her to the spring. She was not aware of
his presence until she had filled her water-jar; then she supposed it to be her own
husband, whom the youth was dressed and adorned to represent, and she allowed him
to approach her. She soon discovered her error, however, but, deeming it prudent to
say nothing, she suffered him to follow her into the house. As he entered, he observed
that many of the slaves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>had already assembled; perhaps they were aware that some trouble was in store for
their master. The latter looked up with an angry face; he felt jealous when he saw
the stranger entering immediately after his wife. He said nothing of this, however,
but asked at once the important question, &#x201c;Have you come to gamble with me?&#x201d; This
he repeated four times, and each time the young <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an said &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Thinking the stranger feared to play with him, No<i>h</i>oílpi went on challenging him recklessly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet myself against yourself;&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll
bet my feet against your feet;&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet my legs against your legs;&#x201d; and so on he
offered to bet every and any part of his body against the same part of his adversary,
ending by mentioning his hair.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">221.</span> In the mean time the party of divine ones, who had been watching from above, came
down, and people from the neighboring pueblos came in, and among these were two boys,
who were dressed in costumes similar to those worn by the wives of the gambler. The
young <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an pointed to these and said, &#x201c;I will bet my wives against your wives.&#x201d; The great
gambler accepted the wager, and the four persons, two women and two mock-women, were
placed sitting in a row near the wall. First they played the game of thirteen chips.
The Bat assisted, as he had promised the son of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an and the latter soon won the game, and with it the wives of No<i>h</i>oílpi.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">222.</span> This was the only game played inside the house; then all went out of doors, and games
of various kinds were played. First they tried nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i>. The track already prepared lay east and west, but, prompted by the Wind God, the
stranger insisted on having a track made from north to south, and again, at the bidding
of Wind, he chose the red stick. The son of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an threw the wheel; at first it seemed about to fall on the gambler&#x2019;s pole, in the
&#x201c;turkey-claw&#x201d; of which it was entangled; but to the great surprise of the gambler
it extricated itself, rolled farther on, and fell on the pole of his opponent. The
latter ran to pick up the ring, lest No<i>h</i>oílpi in doing so might hurt the snake inside; but the gambler was so angry that he
threw his stick away and gave up the game, hoping to do better in the next contest,
which was that of pushing down trees.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">223.</span> For this the great gambler pointed out two small trees, but his opponent insisted
that larger trees must be found. After some search they agreed upon two of good size,
which grew close together, and of these the Wind told the youth which one he must
select. The gambler strained with all his might at his tree, but could not move it,
while his opponent, when his turn came, shoved the other tree prostrate with little
effort, for its roots had all been severed by Gopher.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">224.</span> Then followed a variety of games, on which No<i>h</i>oílpi staked his wealth in shells and precious stones, his houses, and many of his
slaves, and lost all.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">225.</span> The last game was that of the ball. On the line over which the ball was to be knocked
all the people were assembled; on one side were those who still remained slaves; on
the other side were the freedmen and those who had come to wager themselves, hoping
to rescue their kinsmen. No<i>h</i>oílpi bet on this game the last of his slaves and his own person. The gambler struck
his ball a heavy blow, but it did not reach the line; the stranger gave his but a
light tap, and the bird within it flew with it far beyond the line, whereat the released
captives jumped over the line and joined their people.
</p>
<p id="par226"><span class="parNum">226.</span> The victor ordered all the shells, beads, and precious stones, and the great shells,
to be brought forth. He gave the beads and shells to <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, that they might be distributed among the gods; the two great shells were given
to the Sun.<a href="#not77" class="noteref">77</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">227.</span> In the mean time No<i>h</i>oílpi sat to one side saying bitter things, bemoaning his fate, and cursing and threatening
his enemies. &#x201c;I will kill you all with the lightning. I will send war and disease
among you. May the cold freeze you! May the fire burn you! May the waters drown you!&#x201d;
he cried. &#x201c;He has cursed enough,&#x201d; whispered N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i to the son of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an. &#x201c;Put an end to his angry words.&#x201d; So the young victor called No<i>h</i>oílpi to him and said: &#x201c;You have bet yourself and have lost; you are now my slave
and must do my bidding. You are not a god, for my power has prevailed against yours.&#x201d;
The victor had a bow of magic power named E<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n <i>D</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>y&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>, or the Bow of Darkness; he bent this upwards, and placing the string on the ground
he bade his slave stand on the string; then he shot No<i>h</i>oílpi up into the sky as if he had been an arrow. Up and up he went, growing smaller
and smaller to the sight till he faded to a mere speck and finally disappeared altogether.
As he flew upwards he was heard to mutter in the angry tones of abuse and imprecation,
until he was too far away to be heard; but no one could distinguish anything he said
as he ascended.
</p>
<p id="par228"><span class="parNum">228.</span> He flew up in the sky until he came to the home of Békot<i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>d</i>i,<a href="#not78" class="noteref">78</a> the god who carries the moon, and who is supposed by the Navahoes to be identical
with the God of the Americans. He is very old, and dwells in a long row of stone houses.
When No<i>h</i>oílpi arrived at the house of Békot<i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>d</i>i he related to the latter all his misadventures in the lower world and said, &#x201c;Now
I am poor, and this is why I have come to see you.&#x201d; &#x201c;You need be poor no longer,&#x201d;
said Békot<i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>d</i>i; &#x201c;I will provide for you.&#x201d; So he made for the gambler pets or domestic animals of
new kinds, different to those which he had in the Chaco valley; he made for him sheep,
asses, horses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>swine, goats, and fowls. He also gave him <i lang="es">bayeta</i>,<a href="#not79" class="noteref">79</a> and other cloths of bright colors, more beautiful than those woven by his slaves
at K&#x12d;ntyél. He made, too, a new people, the Mexicans, for the gambler to rule over,
and then he sent him back to this world again, but he descended far to the south of
his former abode, and reached the earth in old Mexico.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">229.</span> No<i>h</i>oílpi&#x2019;s people increased greatly in Mexico, and after a while they began to move towards
the north, and build towns along the Rio Grande. No<i>h</i>oílpi came with them until they arrived at a place north of Santa Fé. There they ceased
building, and he returned to old Mexico, where he still lives, and where he is now
the Nakaí <i>D</i>&#x12d;gíni, or God of the Mexicans.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">230.</span> The Navaho who went at the bidding of the Sun to the tryst of the gods stayed with
them till the gambler was shot into the sky. Then he returned to his people and told
all he had seen. The young stranger went back to Tse&#x2bb;gíhi, the home of the yéi.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">231.</span> The wanderers were not long at K&#x12d;ntyél, but while they were they met some of the
Daylight People. From K&#x12d;ntyél they moved to <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>otsos, and here Mai,<a href="#not80" class="noteref">80</a> the Coyote, married a Navaho woman. He remained in the Navaho camp nine days, and
then he went to visit <i>D</i>asáni, the Porcupine. The latter took a piece of bark, scratched his nose with it
till the blood flowed freely out over it, put it on the fire, and there roasted it
slowly until it turned into a piece of fine meat. Porcupine then spread some clean
herbs on the ground, laid the roasted meat on these, and invited his visitor to partake.
Coyote was delighted; he had never had a nicer meal, and when he was leaving he invited
his host to return the visit in two days. At the appointed time Porcupine presented
himself at the hut of Coyote. The latter greeted his guest, bade him be seated, and
rushed out of the house. In a few minutes he returned with a piece of bark. With this
he scratched his nose, as he had seen Porcupine doing, and allowed the blood to flow.
He placed the bloody bark over the fire, where in a moment it burst into flames and
was soon reduced to ashes. Coyote hung his head in shame and Porcupine went home hungry.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">232.</span> Soon after this Coyote visited Maítso,<a href="#not80" class="noteref">80</a> the Wolf. The latter took down, from among the rafters of his hut, two of the old-fashioned
reed arrows with wooden heads, such as the Navahoes used in the ancient days; he pulled
out the wooden points, rolled them on his thigh, moistened them in his mouth, and
buried them in the hot ashes beside the fire. After waiting a little while and talking
to his guest, he raked out from the ashes, where he had buried the arrow points, two
fine cooked puddings of minced meat; these he laid on a mat of fresh herbs and told
Coyote to help himself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>Coyote again enjoyed his meal greatly, and soon after, when he rose to leave, he invited
Wolf to pay him a visit in two days. Wolf went in due time to the house of Coyote,
and when he had seated himself the host took two arrow-heads, as Wolf had done, rolled
them on his thigh, put them in his mouth, and buried them in the hot ashes. After
waiting a while, he raked the ashes and found nothing but two pieces of charred wood
where he had placed the arrow-heads. This time he gave no evidence of his disappointment,
but sat and talked with his guest just as if nothing had happened, until Wolf, seeing
no sign of dinner and becoming very hungry, got up and went home.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">233.</span> In those days the Chicken-hawks and the Hummingbirds were known as great hunters.
They were friendly to one another and dwelt together in one camp.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">234.</span> Coyote went to pay them a visit, and when he arrived at the camp he entered one of
the huts of the Hummingbirds. He found therein two beautiful Hummingbird maidens,
gayly dressed, with rows of deer-hoof pendants on their skirts and shoulders. He lay
down in the lodge and said to the maidens: &#x201c;Where is everybody to-day? I heard there
were many people camped here, but the camp seems deserted.&#x201d; The maidens replied: &#x201c;There
are many people camped here, but to-day the men are all out hunting.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">235.</span> Now, Coyote was a dandy; he was always beautifully dressed; he had a nice otter-skin
quiver and his face was painted in spots. The maidens, when they had looked well at
him, bent their heads together and whispered to one another, &#x201c;He is a handsome young
man. He is beautifully dressed. He must be a person of some importance.&#x201d; He spent
the day gossipping with the maidens and telling them wonderful tales about himself.
&#x201c;Would you know who I am?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I am the God of Ts&#x12d;snad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni Mountain. I have no need to hunt. All I have to do is to will the death of an
animal and it dies. Your people have no need to wear themselves out hunting for game.
I can kill all they want without labor.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">236.</span> At nightfall, when the hunters returned, the maidens left the lodge, went to where
their friends were assembled, and told them all about the visitor. When the maidens
had finished their story, the chief directed one of the young men to go over to the
hut, peep in over the curtain in the doorway, and see what the stranger looked like.
The young man did as he was bidden, making no noise, and looked into the lodge unobserved
by Coyote. When he returned to the chief he said: &#x201c;The stranger is a fine-looking
man and is beautifully dressed. Perhaps he is indeed a god.&#x201d; The chief then said:
&#x201c;It may be that all is true which he has told the maidens. We have to travel far in
all sorts of weather and to work hard to secure food. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>He may know some way to save us from labor, so let us be kind to him. Go, one of you
maidens, back to the lodge to serve him.&#x201d; Hearing these words, the younger of the
two young women returned to the lodge. Her clothing was ornamented with many pendants
of bone and hoof that rattled with every movement she made, and for this reason Coyote
named her T<i>s</i>iké Naz&#x12d;&#x2032;li, or Young Woman Who Rattles.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">237.</span> In the morning she went to the lodge where her people were, and where a good breakfast
was already prepared, and she brought a large dishful of the food for Coyote to eat.
As she was about to depart with the food her people charged her to tell Coyote nothing
of certain bad neighbors of theirs, lest he might visit them and work wonders for
their benefit. But their injunctions came too late. Already T<i>s</i>iké Naz&#x12d;&#x2032;li had told him all about these bad neighbors, and he had made up his mind
to visit them.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">238.</span> When breakfast was over she said: &#x201c;Now the hunters are going out.&#x201d; He replied: &#x201c;I
will go with them.&#x201d; So he joined the party, and they travelled together till they
got to the brow of a high hill which overlooked an extensive country. Here Coyote
told his companions to remain concealed while he went into the plain and drove the
game toward them. When he got out of sight, he tied to his tail a long fagot of shredded
cedar-bark, which he set on fire, and then he ran over the country in a wide circle
as fast as he could go. Everywhere the fagot touched it set fire to the grass, and
raised a long line of flame and smoke which drove the antelope up to where the hunters
were concealed. A great quantity of game was killed; the hunters returned laden with
meat, and their faith in Coyote was unbounded.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">239.</span> Next morning they all went out once more to hunt. Again the hunters concealed themselves
on the brow of a hill, and again Coyote tied the blazing fagot to his tail and ran.
The people on the hilltop watched the line of fire advancing over the plain; but when
it turned around as if to come back to the place from which it started, it suddenly
ceased. Much game was driven toward the party in ambush; but Coyote did not return,
and the hunters went to work cutting up the meat and cooking food for themselves.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">240.</span> Coyote, in the mean time, had gone to seek the bad neighbors. He untied his brand
at the place where the hunters had seen the line of fire cease, and wandered off in
a different direction. After a while he came to two great trees, a spruce and a pine,
growing close together, and filled with chattering birds of two kinds. The spruce-tree
was filled with birds called Ts&#x12d;&#x2032;di Bé<i>z</i>e, and the pine-tree with birds called Ts&#x12d;&#x2032;di <i>S</i>á<i>s</i>i. They were all busily engaged in playing a game which Coyote had never seen before.
They would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>pull out their eyes, toss these up to the top of the tree, cry &#x201c;Drop back, my eyes!
Drop back!&#x201d; and catch the eyes as they descended in their proper sockets. Coyote watched
their play for a long time, and at length, becoming fascinated with the game, he cried
out to the Ts&#x12d;&#x2032;di <i>S</i>á<i>s</i>i in the pine-tree, &#x201c;Pull out my eyes for me. I want to play, too.&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; they replied,
&#x201c;we will have nothing to do with you.&#x201d; Again and again he begged to be allowed to
join in the sport, and again and again they refused him. But when he had pleaded for
the fourth time, they flew down to where Coyote sat, and, taking sharp sticks, they
gouged his eyes out. The eyes were thrown up to the top of the pine-tree, and when
they fell down Coyote caught them in his orbits and could see again as well as ever.
Coyote was delighted with the result of his first venture, and he begged them to pull
his eyes out again, but they said angrily: &#x201c;We do not want to play with you. We have
done enough for you now. Go and leave us.&#x201d; But he continued to whine and beg until
again they pulled out his eyes and tossed them up with the same happy result as before.
Thus four times were his eyes pulled out, thrown upward, and caught back again in
the head. But when he begged them to pull out his eyes for the fifth time, they went
to a distance and held a council among themselves. When they returned they pulled
his eyes out once more; but this time they took pains to pull out the strings of the
eyes (optic nerves) at the same time; these they tied together, and, when the eyes
were again flung up in the tree, they caught on one of the branches and there they
stayed. Now Coyote was in mortal distress. &#x201c;Drop back, my eyes! Drop back!&#x201d; he cried.
But back they never came, and he sat there with his nose pointed up toward the top
of the tree, and he howled and prayed and wept. At last the birds took pity on him
and said: &#x201c;Let us make other eyes for him.&#x201d; So they took a couple of partly dried
pieces of pine gum and rolled them into two balls; these were stuck into the empty
sockets, and, although they were not good eyes, they gave him sight enough to see
his way home. The gum was yellow, and for this reason coyotes have had yellow eyes
ever since.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">241.</span> He crept back, as best he could, to the place where he had left the hunters, and
where he found them cutting and cooking meat. He sat down facing the fire, but he
soon found that his gum eyes were getting soft with the heat, so he turned his side
to the fire. The hunters gave him a piece of raw liver, supposing he would cook it
himself. Not daring to turn towards the fire, lest his eyes should melt altogether,
he threw the liver on the coals without looking, and when he tried afterwards to take
it up he thrust his hand at random into the fire and caught nothing but hot coals
that burned him. Fearing that his strange action was observed, he tried to pass it
off <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>as a joke, and every time he picked up a hot coal he cried: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t burn me, liver!
Don&#x2019;t burn me, liver!&#x201d; After a while the hunters seated around the fire began to notice
his singular motions and words, and one said to another: &#x201c;He does not act as usual.
Go and see what is the matter with him.&#x201d; The hunter who was thus bidden went over
in front of Coyote, looked at him closely, and saw melted gum pouring out from between
his eyelids.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">242.</span> It happened that during the day, while Coyote was absent, a messenger had come to
the camp of the hunters from another camp to tell them that an individual named Mai,
or Coyote, had left his home, and had been seen going toward the camp of the Hummingbirds,
and to warn them against him. &#x201c;He is an idler and a trickster,&#x2014;beware of him,&#x201d; said
the messenger. So when they found out the condition of their visitor they said: &#x201c;This
must be Coyote of whom we have heard. He has been playing with the Ts&#x12d;&#x2032;di <i>S</i>á<i>s</i>i and has lost his eyes.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">243.</span> When they had arrived at this conclusion they started for camp and led the blind
Coyote along. In the mean time they devised a plan for getting rid of him. When they
got home they took the rattling dress of T<i>s</i>iké Naz&#x12d;&#x2032;li and gave her an ordinary garment to wear. Then a Chicken-hawk took the
dress in his beak, and, flying a little distance above the ground, shook the dress
in front of Coyote. The latter, thinking the maiden was there, approached the sound,
and as he did so the Chicken-hawk flew farther away, still shaking the dress. Coyote
followed the rattling sound, and was thus led on to the brink of a deep canyon. Here
the hawk shook the dress beyond the edge of the precipice. Coyote jumped toward where
he heard the sound, fell to the bottom of the canyon, and was dashed to pieces.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">244.</span> But for all this he did not die. He did not, like other beings, keep his vital principle
in his chest, where it might easily be destroyed; he kept it in the tip of his nose
and in the end of his tail, where no one would expect to find it; so after a while
he came to life again, went back to the camp of the birds, and asked for T<i>s</i>iké Naz&#x12d;&#x2032;li. They told him she was gone away, and ordered him angrily to leave, telling
him they knew who he was, and that he was a worthless fellow.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">245.</span> Coyote left the camp of the birds, and wandered around till he came to the house
of one of the anáye, or alien gods, named Yé<i>l</i>apahi,<a href="#not71" class="noteref">71</a> or Brown Giant. He was half as tall as the tallest pine-tree, and he was evil and
cruel. Coyote said to the Brown Giant, &#x201c;Yé<i>l</i>apahi, I want to be your servant; I can be of great help to you. The reason that you
often fail to catch your enemies is that you cannot run fast enough. I can run fast
and jump far; I can jump over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>four bushes at one bound. I can run after your enemies and help you to catch them.&#x201d;
&#x201c;My cousin,&#x201d; responded Brown Giant, &#x201c;you can do me service if you will.&#x201d; Coyote then
directed the giant to build a sweat-house for himself, and, while the latter was building
it, Coyote set out on another errand.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">246.</span> In those days there was a maiden of renowned beauty in the land. She was the only
sister of eleven divine brothers.<a href="#not81" class="noteref">81</a> She had been sought in marriage by the Sun and by many potent gods, but she had refused
them all because they could not comply with certain conditions which she imposed op
all suitors. It was to visit her that Coyote went when he left Yé<i>l</i>apahi at work on the sweat-house.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">247.</span> &#x201c;Why have you refused so many beautiful gods who want you for a wife?&#x201d; said Coyote
to the maiden after he had greeted her. &#x201c;It would profit you nothing to know,&#x201d; she
replied, &#x201c;for you could not comply with any one of my demands.&#x201d; Four times he asked
her this question, and three times he got the same reply. When he asked her the fourth
time she answered: &#x201c;In the first place, I will not marry any one who has not killed
one of the anáye.&#x201d; When he heard this Coyote arose and returned to the place where
he had left Yé<i>l</i>apahi.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">248.</span> On his way back he looked carefully for the bone of some big animal which Great Wolf
had slain and eaten. At length he found a long thigh-bone which suited his purpose.
He took this home with him, concealing it under his shirt. When Coyote got back, Yé<i>l</i>apahi had finished the sweat-house.<a href="#not82" class="noteref">82</a> Together they built the fire, heated the stones, and spread the carpet of leaves.
Coyote hung over the doorway four blankets of sky,&#x2014;one white, one blue, one yellow,
and one black, and put the hot stones into the lodge. Then they hung their arms and
clothes on a neighboring tree, entered the sudatory, and sat down.<a href="#not83" class="noteref">83</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">249.</span> &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; said Coyote, &#x201c;if you want to become a fast runner, I will show you what to
do. You must cut the flesh of your thigh down to the bone and then break the bone.
It will heal again in a moment, and when it heals you will be stronger and swifter
than ever. I often do this myself, and every time I do it I am fleeter of foot than
I was before. I will do it now, so that you may observe how it is done.&#x201d; Coyote then
produced a great stone knife and pretended to cut his own thigh, wailing and crying
in the mean time, and acting as if he suffered great pain. After a while of this pretence
he put the old femur on top of his thigh, held it by both ends, and said to the giant:
&#x201c;I have now reached the bone. Feel it.&#x201d; When the giant had put forth his hand, in
the absolute darkness of the sweat-house, and felt the bare bone, Coyote shoved the
hand away and struck the bone hard with the edge of his knife several <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>times until he broke the bone, and he made the giant feel the fractured ends. Then
he threw away the old bone, rubbed spittle on his thigh, prayed and sang, and in a
little while presented his sound thigh to the giant for his examination, saying: &#x201c;See!
my limb is healed again. It is as well as ever.&#x201d; When he had thus spoken Coyote handed
his knife to Yé<i>l</i>apahi, and the latter with many tears and loud howls slowly amputated his own thigh.
When the work was done he put the two severed ends together, spat upon them, sang
and prayed, as Coyote had done. &#x201c;<i>T</i>óhe! <i>T</i>óhe! <i>T</i>óhe!&#x201d;<a href="#not84" class="noteref">84</a> he cried, &#x201c;Heal together! Grow together!&#x201d; he commanded; but the severed ends would
not unite. &#x201c;Cousin,&#x201d; he called to Coyote, &#x201c;help me to heal this leg.&#x201d; Coyote thought
it was now time to finish his work. He ran from the sweat-house, seized his bow, and
discharged his arrows into the helpless Yé<i>l</i>apahi, who soon expired with many wounds.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">250.</span> Coyote scalped his victim, and tied the scalp to the top of a branch which he broke
from a cedar-tree; as further evidence of his victory, he took the quiver and weapons
of the slain and set out for the lodge of the maiden. He knew she could not mistake
the scalp, for the yéi, in those days, had yellow hair,<a href="#not85" class="noteref">85</a> such as no other people had. When he reached the lodge he said to the maiden: &#x201c;Here
is the scalp and here are the weapons of one of the anáye. Now you must marry me.&#x201d;
&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said the maiden, &#x201c;not yet; I have not told you all that one must do in order
to win me. He must be killed four times and come to life again four times.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you
speak the truth? Have you told me all?&#x201d; said Coyote. &#x201c;Yes; I speak only the truth,&#x201d;
she replied. Four times he asked this question, and four times he received the same
answer. When she had spoken for the fourth time Coyote said: &#x201c;Here I am. Do with me
as you will.&#x201d; The maiden took him a little distance from the lodge, laid him on the
ground, beat him with a great club until she thought she had smashed every bone in
his body, and left him for dead. But the point of his nose and the end of his tail
she did not smash. She hurried back to her hut, for she had much work to do. She was
the only woman in a family of twelve. She cooked the food and tanned the skins, and
besides she made baskets. At this particular time she was engaged in making four baskets.
When she returned to the lodge she sat down and went on with her basket-work; but
she had not worked long before she became aware that some one was standing in the
doorway, and, looking up, she beheld Coyote. &#x201c;Here I am,&#x201d; he said; &#x201c;I have won one
game; there are only three more to win.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">251.</span> She made no reply, but took him off farther than she had taken him before, and pounded
him to pieces with a club. She threw <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>the pieces away in different directions and returned to her work again; but she had
not taken many stitches in her basket when again the resurrected Coyote appeared in
the doorway, saying: &#x201c;I have won two games; there are only two more to win.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">252.</span> Again she led him forth, but took him still farther away from the lodge than she
had taken him before, and with a heavy club pounded him into a shapeless mass, until
she thought he must certainly be dead. She stood a long time gazing at the pounded
flesh, and studying what she would do with it to make her work sure. She carried the
mass to a great rock, and there she beat it into still finer pieces. These she scattered
farther than she had scattered the pieces before, and went back to the house. But
she had still failed to injure the two vital spots. It took the Coyote a longer time
on this occasion than on the previous occasions to pull himself together; still she
had not wrought much on her basket when he again presented himself and said: &#x201c;I have
won three games; there is but one more game to win.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">253.</span> The fourth time she led him farther away than ever. She not only mashed him to pieces,
but she mixed the pieces with earth, ground the mixture, like corn, between two stones,
until it was ground to a fine powder, and scattered this powder far and wide. But
again she neglected to crush the point of the nose and the tip of the tail. She went
back to the lodge and worked a long time undisturbed. She had just begun to entertain
hopes that she had seen the last of her unwelcome suitor when again he entered the
door. Now, at last, she could not refuse him. He had fulfilled all her conditions,
and she consented to become his wife. He remained all the afternoon. At sunset they
heard the sound of approaching footsteps, and she said: &#x201c;My brothers are coming. Some
of them are evil of mind and may do you harm. You must hide yourself.&#x201d; She hid him
behind a pile of skins, and told him to be quiet.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">254.</span> When the brothers entered the lodge they said to their sister: &#x201c;Here is some fat
young venison which we bring you. Put it down to boil and put some of the fat into
the pot, for our faces are burned by the wind and we want to grease them.&#x201d; The woman
slept on the north side of the lodge and kept there her household utensils. She had
about half of the lodge to herself. The men slept on the south side, the eldest next
to the door.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">255.</span> The pot was put on and the fire replenished, and when it began to burn well an odor
denoting the presence of some beast filled the lodge. One of the brothers said: &#x201c;It
smells as if some animal had been in the wood-pile. Let us throw out this wood and
get fresh sticks from the bottom of the pile.&#x201d; They did as he desired; but the unpleasant
odors continued to annoy them, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>again the wood was taken from the fire and thrown away. Thinking the whole pile of
wood was tainted with the smell, they went out, broke fresh branches from trees, and
built the fire up again; but this did not abate the rank odor in the least. Then one
said: &#x201c;Perhaps the smell is in the water. Tell us, little sister, where did you get
the water in the pot?&#x201d; &#x201c;I got it at the spring where I always get it,&#x201d; she replied.
But they got her to throw out the water and fill the pot with snow, and to put the
meat down to boil again. In spite of all their pains the stench was as bad as ever.
At length one of the brothers turned to his sister and said: &#x201c;What is the cause of
this odor? It is not in the wood. It is not in the water. Whence comes it?&#x201d; She was
silent. He repeated the question three times, yet she made no answer. But when the
question had been asked for the fourth time, Coyote jumped out of his hiding-place
into the middle of the lodge and cried: &#x201c;It is I, my brothers-in-law!&#x201d; &#x201c;Run out there!&#x201d;
the brothers commanded, and turning to their sister they said: &#x201c;Run out you with him!&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">256.</span> They both departed from the lodge. As Coyote went out he took a brand from the fire,
and with this he lighted a new fire. Then he broke boughs from the neighboring trees
and built a shelter for himself and his wife to live in. When this was completed she
went back to the lodge of her brothers, took out her pots, skins, four awls, baskets,
and all her property, and carried them to her new home.
</p>
<p id="par257"><span class="parNum">257.</span> One of the elder brothers said to the youngest: &#x201c;Go out to-night and watch the couple,
and see what sort of a man this is that we have for a brother-in-law. Do not enter
the shelter, but lie hidden outside and observe them.&#x201d; So the youngest brother went
forth and hid himself near the shelter, where he could peep in and see by the light
of the fire what took place and hear what was said. The pair sat side by side near
the fire. Presently the woman laid her hand in a friendly manner on Coyote&#x2019;s knee,
but Coyote threw it away. These motions were repeated four times, and when he had
thrown her hand away for the fourth time he said: &#x201c;I have sworn never to take a woman
for a wife until I have killed her four times.&#x201d; For a while the woman remained silent
and gazed at the fire. At length she said: &#x201c;Here I am. Do with me as you will.&#x201d; (The
myth then relates four deaths and resurrections of the woman, similar to those of
the Coyote, but it does not state how or where she preserved her vital principle.)
When she returned for the fourth time she lay down, and Coyote soon followed her to
her couch. From time to time during the night they held long, low conversations, of
which the listener could hear but little. At dawn the watcher went home. In reply
to the questions of his brothers he said: &#x201c;I cannot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>tell you all that I saw and heard, and they said much that I could not hear; but all
that I did hear and behold was t<i>s</i>&#x12d;ndá<i>s</i>&#x201d; (devilish, evil).
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">258.</span> Next morning the brothers proposed to go out hunting. While they were getting ready
Coyote came and asked leave to join them, but they said to him tauntingly: &#x201c;No; stay
at home with your wife; she may be lonely and may need some one to talk to her,&#x201d; and
they chased him out of the lodge. Just as they were about to leave he came back again
and begged them to take him with them. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; they replied, &#x201c;the woman will want you
to carry wood; you must stay at home with her.&#x201d; They bade him begone and set out on
their journey. They had not gone far on their way when he overtook them, and for the
third time asked to be allowed to join the party; but again they drove him back with
scornful words. They travelled on till they came to the edge of a deep canyon bordered
with very steep cliffs, and here Coyote was seen again, skulking behind them. For
the fourth time he pleaded with them; but now the youngest brother took his part,
and suggested that Coyote might assist in driving game towards them. So, after some
deliberation, they consented to take Coyote along. At the edge of the canyon they
made a bridge of rainbow,<a href="#not86" class="noteref">86</a> on which they proceeded to cross the chasm. Before the brothers reached the opposite
bluff Coyote jumped on it from the bridge, with a great bound, and began to frolic
around, saying: &#x201c;This is a nice place to play.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">259.</span> They travelled farther on, and after a while came to a mesa, or table-land, which
projected into a lower plain, and was connected with the plateau on which they stood
by a narrow neck of level land. It was a mesa much like that on which the three eastern
towns of the Mokis stand, with high, precipitous sides and a narrow entrance. On the
neck of land they observed the tracks of four Rocky Mountain sheep, which had gone
in on the mesa but had not returned. They had reason, therefore, to believe that the
sheep were still on the mesa. At the neck they built a fire, sat down near it, and
sent Coyote in on the mesa to drive the sheep out. Their plans were successful; soon
the four sheep came running out over the neck, within easy range of the hunters&#x2019; weapons,
and were all killed. Presently Coyote returned and lay down on the sand.
</p>
<p id="par260"><span class="parNum">260.</span> In those days the horns of the Rocky Mountain sheep were flat and fleshy and could
be eaten. The eldest brother said: &#x201c;I will take the horns for my share.&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; said
Coyote, &#x201c;the horns shall be mine: give them to me.&#x201d; Three times each repeated the
same declaration. When both had spoken for the fourth time, the eldest brother, to
end the controversy, drew out his knife and began to cut one of the horns; as he did
so Coyote cried out, &#x201c;Ts&#x12d;nántlehi! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>Ts&#x12d;nántlehi! Ts&#x12d;nántlehi! Ts&#x12d;nántlehi!&#x201d; (Turn to bone! Turn to bone! Turn to bone!
Turn to bone!) Each time he cried, the horn grew harder and harder, and the knife
slipped as it cut, hacking but not severing the horn. This is why the horns of the
Rocky Mountain sheep are now hard, not fleshy, and to this day they bear the marks
of the hunter&#x2019;s knife. &#x201c;T<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ndi! T<i>s</i>&#x12d;ndá<i>s</i> bi<i>l</i>náal<i>t</i>i!&#x201d; (You devil! You evil companion in travel!) said the hunter to Coyote.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">261.</span> The hunters gathered all the meat into one pile, and by means of the mystic power
which they possessed they reduced it to a very small compass. They tied it in a small
bundle which one person might easily carry, and they gave it to Coyote to take home,
saying to him, &#x201c;Travel round by the head of the canyon over which we crossed and go
not through it, for they are evil people who dwell there, and open not your bundle
until you get home.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">262.</span> The bundle was lifted to his back and he started for home, promising to heed all
that had been told him. But as soon as he was well out of sight of his companions
he slipped his bundle to the ground and opened it. At once the meat expanded and became
again a heap of formidable size, such that he could not bind it up again or carry
it; so he hung some of it up on the trees and bushes; he stuck part of it into crevices
in the rocks; a portion he left scattered on the ground; he tied up as much as he
could carry in a new bundle, and with this he continued on his journey.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">263.</span> When he came to the edge of the forbidden canyon he looked down and saw some birds
playing a game he had never witnessed before. They rolled great stones down the slope,
which extended from the foot of the cliff to the bottom of the valley, and stood on
the stones while they were rolling; yet the birds were not upset or crushed or hurt
in the least by this diversion. The sight so pleased Coyote that he descended into
the canyon and begged to be allowed to join in the sport. The birds rolled a stone
gently for him; he got on it and handled himself so nimbly that he reached the bottom
of the slope without injury. Again and again he begged them to give him a trial until
he thus three times descended without hurting himself. When he asked the birds for
the fourth time to roll a stone for him they became angry and hurled it with such
force that Coyote lost his footing, and he and the stone rolled over one another to
the bottom of the slope, and he screamed and yelped all the way down.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">264.</span> After this experience he left the birds and travelled on until he observed some Otters
at play by the stream at the bottom of the canyon. They were playing the Navaho game
of nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i>. They bet their skins against one another on the results of the game. But when one
lost his skin at play he jumped into the water and came <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>out with a new skin. Coyote approached the Otters and asked to be allowed to take
part in the game, but the Otters had heard about him and knew what a rascal he was.
They refused him and told him to begone; but still he remained and pleaded. After
a while they went apart and talked among themselves, and when they returned they invited
Coyote to join them in their game. Coyote bet his skin and lost it. The moment he
lost, the Otters all rushed at him, and, <span class="corr" id="xd29e5588" title="Source: notwitstanding">notwithstanding</span> his piteous cries, they tore the hide from his back, beginning at the root of his
tail and tearing forward. When they came to the vital spot at the end of his nose
his wails were terrible. When he found himself denuded of his skin he jumped into
the water, as he had seen the Otters doing; but, alas! his skin did not come back
to him. He jumped again and again into the water; but came out every time as bare
as he went in. At length he became thoroughly exhausted, and lay down in the water
until the Otters took pity on him and pulled him out. They dragged him to a badger
hole, threw him in there, and covered him up with earth. Previous to this adventure
Coyote had a beautiful, smooth fur like that of the otter. When he dug his way out
of the badger hole he was again covered with hair, but it was no longer the glossy
fur which he once wore; it was coarse and rough, much like that of the badger, and
such a pelt the coyotes have worn ever since.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">265.</span> But this sad experience did not make him mend his ways. He again went round challenging
the Otters to further play, and betting his new skin on the game. &#x201c;Your skin is of
no value; no one would play for it. Begone!&#x201d; they said. Being often refused and insolently
treated, he at length became angry, retired to a safe distance, and began to revile
the Otters shamefully. &#x201c;You are braggarts,&#x201d; he cried; &#x201c;you pretend to be brave, but
you are cowards. Your women are like yourselves: their heads are flat; their eyes
are little; their teeth stick out; they are ugly; while I have a bride as beautiful
as the sun.&#x201d; He shook his foot at them as if to say, &#x201c;I am fleeter than you.&#x201d; He would
approach them, and when they made motion as if to pursue him, he would take a big
jump and soon place himself beyond their reach. When they quieted down, he would approach
them again and continue to taunt and revile them. After a while he went to the cliff,
to a place of safety, and shouted from there his words of derision. The Otters talked
together, and said they could suffer his abuse no longer, that something must be done,
and they sent word to the chiefs of the Spiders, who lived farther down the stream,
telling them what had occurred, and asking for their aid.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">266.</span> The Spiders crept up the bluff, went round behind where Coyote sat cursing and scolding,
and wove strong webs in the trees <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>and bushes. When their work was finished they told the Otters what they had done,
and the latter started to climb the bluff and attack Coyote. Conscious of his superior
swiftness, he acted as if indifferent to them, and allowed them to come quite close
before he turned to run; but he did not run far until he was caught in the webs of
the Spiders. Then the Otters seized him and dragged him, howling, to the foot of the
hill. He clung so hard to the grasses and shrubs as he passed that they were torn
out by the roots. When the Otters got him to the bottom of the hill they killed him,
or seemed to kill him. The Cliff Swallows (<i>H</i>a<i>s</i>t<i>s</i>ó<i>s</i>i)<a href="#not21" class="noteref">21</a> flew down from the walls of the canyon and tore him in pieces; they carried off the
fragments to their nests, leaving only a few drops of blood on the ground; they tore
his skin into strips and made of these bands which they put around their heads, and
this accounts for the band which the cliff swallow wears upon his brow to-day.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">267.</span> It was nightfall when the brothers came home. They saw that Coyote had not yet returned,
and they marvelled what had become of him. When they entered the lodge and sat down,
the sister came and peeped in over the portière, scanned the inside of the lodge,
and looked inquiringly at them. They did not speak to her until she had done this
four times, then the eldest brother said: &#x201c;Go back and sleep, and don&#x2019;t worry about
that worthless man of yours. He is not with us, and we know not what has become of
him. We suppose he has gone into the canyon, where we warned him not to go, and has
been killed.&#x201d; She only said, &#x201c;What have you done with him?&#x201d; and went away in anger.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">268.</span> Before they lay down to sleep they sent the youngest brother out to hide where he
had hidden the night before to watch their sister, and this is what he saw: At first
she pretended to go to sleep. After a while she rose and sat facing the east. Then
she faced in turn the south, the west, and the north, moving sunwise. When this was
done she pulled out her right eye-tooth, broke a large piece from one of her four
bone awls and inserted it in the place of the tooth, making a great tusk where the
little tooth had once been. As she did this she said aloud: &#x201c;He who shall hereafter
dream of losing a right eye-tooth shall lose a brother.&#x201d; After this she opened her
mouth to the four points of the compass in the order in which she had faced them before,
tore out her left eye-tooth and inserted in its place the pointed end of another awl.
As she made this tusk she said: &#x201c;He who dreams of losing his left eye-tooth shall
lose a sister.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">269.</span> The watcher then returned to his brothers and told them what he had seen and heard.
&#x201c;Go back,&#x201d; said they, &#x201c;and watch her again, for you have not seen all her deeds.&#x201d;
When he went <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>back he saw her make, as she had done before, two tusks in her lower jaw. When she
had made that on the right she said: &#x201c;He who dreams of losing this tooth (right lower
canine) shall lose a child;&#x201d; and when she made that on the left she said: &#x201c;He who
dreams of losing this tooth (left lower canine) shall lose a parent.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">270.</span> When she first began to pull out her teeth, hair began to grow on her hands; as she
went on with her mystic work the hair spread up her arms and her legs, leaving only
her breasts bare. The young man now crept back to the lodge where his brethren waited
and told them what he had seen. &#x201c;Go back,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;and hide again. There is more
for you to see.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">271.</span> When he got back to his hiding-place the hair had grown over her breasts, and she
was covered with a coat of shaggy hair like that of a bear. She continued to move
around in the direction of the sun&#x2019;s apparent course, pausing and opening her mouth
at the east, the south, the west, and the north as she went. After a while her ears
began to wag, her snout grew long, her teeth were heard to gnash, her nails turned
into claws. He watched her until dawn, when, fearing he might be discovered, he returned
to his lodge and told his brothers all that had happened. They said: &#x201c;These must be
the mysteries that Coyote explained to her the first night.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">272.</span> In a moment after the young man had told his story they heard the whistling of a
bear, and soon a she-bear rushed past the door of the lodge, cracking the branches
as she went. She followed the trail which Coyote had taken the day before and disappeared
in the woods.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">273.</span> At night she came back groaning. She had been in the fatal canyon all day, fighting
the slayers of Coyote, and she had been wounded in many places. Her brothers saw a
light in her hut, and from time to time one of their number would go and peep in through
an aperture to observe what was happening within. All night she walked around the
fire. At intervals she would, by means of her magic, draw arrow-heads out of her body
and heal the wounds.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">274.</span> Next morning the bear-woman again rushed past the lodge of her brethren, and again
went off toward the fatal canyon. At night she returned, as before, groaning and bleeding,
and again spent the long night in drawing forth missiles and healing her wounds by
means of her magic rites.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">275.</span> Thus she continued to do for four days and four nights; but at the end of the fourth
day she had conquered all her enemies; she had slain many, and those she had not killed
she had dispersed. The swallows flew up into the high cliffs to escape her vengeance;
the otters hid themselves in the water; the spiders retreated into holes in the ground,<a href="#not87" class="noteref">87</a> and in such places these creatures have been obliged to dwell ever since.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">276.</span> During these four days, the brothers remained in their camp; but at the end of that
time, feeling that trouble was in store for them, they decided to go away. They left
the youngest brother at home, and the remaining ten divided themselves into four different
parties; one of which travelled to the east, another to the south, another to the
west, and another to the north.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">277.</span> When they were gone, the Whirlwind, Níyol, and the Knife Boy, Pé<i>s</i>a<i>s</i>ike, came to the lodge to help the younger brother who had remained behind. They dug
for him a hole under the centre of the <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án; and from this they dug four branching tunnels, running east, south, west, and
north, and over the end of each tunnel they put a window of gypsum to let in light
from above. They gave him four weapons,&#x2014;ats&#x12d;nikl&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>s</i>ka, the chain-lightning arrow; <i>h</i>atsoil<i>h</i>álka (an old-fashioned stone knife as big as the open hand); natsil&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>t</i>ka, the rainbow arrow; and <i>h</i>at<i>s</i>&#x12d;lk&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>s</i>ka, the sheet-lightning arrow. They roofed his hiding-place with four flat stones,
one white, one blue, one yellow, and one black. They put earth over all these, smoothing
the earth and tramping it down so that it should look like the natural floor of the
lodge. They gave him two monitors, N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i, the Wind, at his right ear, to warn him by day of the approach of danger; and T<i>s</i>a<i>l</i>yé<i>l</i>, darkness, at his left ear, to warn him by night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">278.</span> When morning came and the bear-woman went forth she discovered that her brothers
had departed. She poured water on the ground (<i>h</i>al&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>) to see which way they had gone. The water flowed to the east; she rushed on in that
direction and soon overtook three of the fugitives, whom she succeeded in killing.
Then she went back to her hut to see what had become of her other brothers. Again
she poured water on the level ground and it flowed off to the south; she followed
in that direction and soon overtook three others, whom she likewise slew. Returning
to the lodge she again performed her divination by means of water. This time she was
directed to the west, and, going that way, she overtook and killed three more of the
men. Again she sought the old camp and poured on the ground water, which flowed to
the north; going on in this direction she encountered but one man, and him she slew.
Once more she went back to discover what had become of her last brother. She poured
water for the fifth time on the level ground; it sank directly into the earth.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">279.</span> The brothers had always been very successful hunters and their home was always well
supplied with meat. In consequence of this they had had many visitors who built in
their neighborhood temporary shelters, such as the Navahoes build now when they come
to remain only a short time at a place, and the remains of these shelters surrounded
the deserted hut. She scratched in all these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>places to find traces of the fugitive, without success, and in doing so she gradually
approached the deserted hut. She scratched all around outside the hut and then went
inside. She scratched around the edge of the hut and then worked toward the centre,
until at length she came to the fireplace. Here she found the earth was soft as if
recently disturbed, and she dug rapidly downward with her paws. She soon came to the
stones, and, removing these, saw her last remaining brother hidden beneath them. &#x201c;I
greet you, my younger brother! Come up, I want to see you,&#x201d; she said in a coaxing
voice. Then she held out one finger to him and said: &#x201c;Grasp my finger and I will help
you up.&#x201d; But Wind told him not to grasp her finger; that if he did she would throw
him upwards, that he would fall half dead at her feet and be at her mercy. &#x201c;Get up
without her help,&#x201d; whispered N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">280.</span> He climbed out of the hole on the east side and walked toward the east. She ran toward
him in a threatening manner, but he looked at her calmly and said: &#x201c;It is I, your
younger brother.&#x201d; Then she approached him in a coaxing way, as a dog approaches one
with whom he wishes to make friends, and she led him back toward the deserted <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án. But as he approached it the Wind whispered: &#x201c;We have had sorrow there, let us
not enter,&#x201d; so he would not go in, and this is the origin of the custom now among
the Navahoes never to enter a house in which death had occurred.<a href="#not91" class="noteref">91</a>
</p>
<p id="par281"><span class="parNum">281.</span> &#x201c;Come,&#x201d; she then said, &#x201c;and sit with your face to the west, and let me comb your
hair.&#x201d; (It was now late in the afternoon.) &#x201c;Heed her not,&#x201d; whispered Wind; &#x201c;sit facing
the north, that you watch her shadow and see what she does. It is thus that she has
killed your brothers.&#x201d; They both sat down, she behind him, and she untied his queue
and proceeded to arrange his hair, while he watched her out of the corner of his eye.
Soon he observed her snout growing longer and approaching his head, and he noticed
that her ears were wagging. &#x201c;What does it mean that your snout grows longer and that
your ears move so?&#x201d; he asked. She did not reply, but drew her snout in and kept her
ears still. When these occurrences had taken place for the fourth time, Wind whispered
in his ear: &#x201c;Let not this happen again. If she puts out her snout the fifth time she
will bite your head off. Yonder, where you see that chattering squirrel, are her vital
parts. He guards them for her. Now run and destroy them.&#x201d; He rose and ran toward the
vital parts and she ran after him. Suddenly, between them a large yucca<a href="#not88" class="noteref">88</a> sprang up to retard her steps, and then a cane cactus,<a href="#not89" class="noteref">89</a> and then another yucca, and then another cactus of a different kind. She ran faster
than he, but was so delayed in running around the plants that he reached the vitals
before her, and heard the lungs breathing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>under the weeds that covered them. He drew forth his chain-lightning arrow, shot it
into the weeds, and saw a bright stream of blood spurting up. At the same instant
the bear-woman fell with the blood streaming from her side.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">282.</span> &#x201c;See!&#x201d; whispered N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i, the Wind, &#x201c;the stream of blood from her body and the stream from her vitals flow
fast and approach one another. If they meet she will revive, and then your danger
will be greater than ever. Draw, with your stone knife, a mark on the ground between
the approaching streams.&#x201d; The young man did as he was bidden, when instantly the blood
coagulated and ceased to flow.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">283.</span> Then the young man said: &#x201c;You shall live again, but no longer as the mischievous
T<i>s</i>iké <i>S</i>a<i>s</i> <span class="corr" id="xd29e5752" title="Source: Nátlehi">Nátlehi</span>.<a href="#not90" class="noteref">90</a> You shall live in other forms, where you may be of service to your kind and not a
thing of evil.&#x201d; He cut off the head and said to it: &#x201c;Let us see if in another life
you will do better. When you come to life again, act well, or again I will slay you.&#x201d;
He threw the head at the foot of a piñon-tree and it changed into a bear, which started
at once to walk off. But presently it stopped, shaded its eyes with one paw, and looked
back at the man, saying: &#x201c;You have bidden me to act well; but what shall I do if others
attack me?&#x201d; &#x201c;Then you may defend yourself,&#x201d; said the young man; &#x201c;but begin no quarrel,
and be ever a friend to your people, the <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb;. Go yonder to Black Mountain (<span class="corr" id="xd29e5765" title="Source: Ds&#x12d;ll&#x12d;z&#x12d; n">Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n</span>) and dwell there.&#x201d; There are now in Black Mountain many bears which are descended
from this bear.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">284.</span> The hero cut off the nipples and said to them: &#x201c;Had you belonged to a good woman
and not to a foolish witch, it might have been your luck to suckle men. You were of
no use to your kind; but now I shall make you of use in another form.&#x201d; He threw the
nipples up into a piñon-tree, heretofore fruitless, and they became edible pine nuts.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">285.</span> Next he sought the homes of his friends, the holy ones, Níyol and Pé<i>s</i>a<i>s</i>ike. They led him to the east, to the south, to the west, and to the north, where
the corpses of his brothers lay, and these they restored to life for him. They went
back to the place where the brothers had dwelt before and built a new house; but they
did not return to the old home, for that was now a t<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ndi <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án and accursed.<a href="#not91" class="noteref">91</a>
</p>
<p id="par286"><span class="parNum">286.</span> The holy ones then gave to the young hero the name of <i>L</i>éyaneyani, or Reared Under the Ground, because they had hidden him in the earth when
his brethren fled from the wrath of his sister. They bade him go and dwell at a place
called A<i>t</i>áhy&#x12d;tsoi (Big Point on the Edge), which is in the shape of a <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án, or Navaho hut, and here we think he still dwells.

<p id="par287" class="first"><span class="parNum">287.</span> The <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; now removed to Tse&#x2bb;<i>l</i>akaíia (White Standing Rock), where, a few days after they arrived, they found on
the ground a small turquoise image of a woman; this they preserved. Of late the monsters
(anáye, alien gods) had been actively pursuing and devouring the people, and at the
time this image was found there were only four persons remaining alive;<a href="#not92" class="noteref">92</a> these were an old man and woman and their two children, a young man and a young woman.
Two days after the finding of the image, early in the morning, before they rose, they
heard the voice of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, the Talking God, crying his call of &#x201c;Wu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hu&#x201d; so faint and far that they could
scarcely hear it. After a while the call was repeated a second time, nearer and louder
than at first. Again, after a brief silence, the call was heard for the third time,
still nearer and still louder. The fourth call was loud and clear, as if sounded near
at hand;<a href="#not26" class="noteref">26</a> as soon as it ceased, the shuffling tread of moccasined feet was heard, and a moment
later the god <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i stood before them.

<p><span class="parNum">288.</span> He told the four people to come up to the top of T<i>s</i>olíhi after twelve nights had passed, bringing with them the turquoise image they
had found, and at once he departed. They pondered deeply on his words, and every day
they talked among themselves, wondering why <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i had summoned them to the mountain.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">289.</span> On the morning of the appointed day they ascended the mountain by a holy trail,<a href="#not93" class="noteref">93</a> and on a level spot, near the summit, they met a party that awaited them there. They
found there <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an (the Home God), White Body (who came up from the lower world with the <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb;), the eleven brothers (of Maid Who Becomes a Bear), the Mirage Stone People,
the Daylight People standing in the east, the Blue Sky People standing in the south,
the Yellow Light People standing in the west, and the Darkness People standing in
the north. White Body stood in the east among the Daylight People, bearing in his
hand a small image of a woman wrought in white shell, about the same size and shape
as the blue image which the Navahoes bore.
</p>
<p id="par290"><span class="parNum">290.</span> <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i laid down a sacred buckskin with its head toward the west. The Mirage Stone People
laid on the buckskin, heads west, the two little images,&#x2014;of turquoise and white shell,&#x2014;a
white and a yellow ear of corn, the Pollen Boy, and the Grasshopper Girl. On top of
all these <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i laid another sacred buckskin with its head to the east, and under this they now
put N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i (Wind).
</p>
<p id="par291"><span class="parNum">291.</span> Then the assembled crowd stood so as to form a circle, leaving in the east an opening
through which <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>might pass in and out, and they sang the sacred song of <i>H</i>o<i>z</i>ó<i>n</i>gis&#x12d;n. Four times the gods entered and raised the cover. When they raised it for the
fourth time, the images and the ears of corn were found changed to living beings in
human form: the turquoise image had become Estsánatlehi, the Woman Who Changes (or
rejuvenates herself); the white shell image had become Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán, the White Shell Woman; the white ear of corn had become Na<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>kai A<i>s</i>iké; the White Corn Boy and the yellow ear of corn, Na<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>tsoi A<i>t</i>é<i>t</i>, the Yellow Corn Girl.<a href="#not94" class="noteref">94</a> After the ceremony, White Body took Pollen Boy, Grasshopper Girl, White Corn Boy,
and Yellow Corn Girl with him into T<i>s</i>olíhi; the rest of the assembly departed, and the two divine sisters, Estsánatlehi<a href="#not95" class="noteref">95</a> and Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán,<a href="#not96" class="noteref">96</a> were left on the mountain alone.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">292.</span> The women remained here four nights; on the fourth morning Estsánatlehi said: &#x201c;<i>S</i>it&#x115;&#x2032;<i>z</i>i (younger sister), why should we remain here? Let us go to yonder high point and
look around us.&#x201d; They went to the highest point of the mountain, and when they had
been there several days Estsánatlehi said: &#x201c;It is lonely here; we have no one to speak
to but ourselves; we see nothing but that which rolls over our heads (the sun), and
that which drops below us (a small dripping waterfall). I wonder if they can be people.
I shall stay here and wait for the one in the morning, while you go down among the
rocks and seek the other.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">293.</span> In the morning Estsánatlehi found a bare, flat rock and lay on it with her feet to
the east, and the rising sun shone upon her. Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán went down where the dripping waters descended and allowed them to fall
upon her. At noon the women met again on the mountain top and Estsánatlehi said to
her sister: &#x201c;It is sad to be so lonesome. How can we make people so that we may have
others of our kind to talk to?&#x201d; Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán answered: &#x201c;Think, Elder Sister; perhaps after some days you may plan how
this is to be done.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">294.</span> Four days after this conversation Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán said: &#x201c;Elder Sister, I feel something strange moving within me; what can
it be?&#x201d; and Estsánatlehi answered: &#x201c;It is a child. It was for this that you lay under
the waterfall. I feel, too, the motions of a child within me. It was for this that
I let the sun shine upon me.&#x201d; Soon after the voice of <span class="corr" id="xd29e6000" title="Source: Hastseyalti"><i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i</span> was heard four times, as usual, and after the last call he and <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li<a href="#not98" class="noteref">98</a> appeared. They came to prepare the women for their approaching delivery.<a href="#not99" class="noteref">99</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">295.</span> In four days more they felt the commencing throes of labor, and one said to the other:
&#x201c;I think my child is coming.&#x201d; She had scarcely spoken when the voice of the approaching
god was heard, and soon <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i and <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li (Water Sprinkler) were seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>approaching. The former was the accoucheur of Estsánatlehi, and the latter of <span class="corr" id="xd29e6039" title="Source: Yolkái">Yo<i>l</i>kaí</span> Estsán.<a href="#not100" class="noteref">100</a> To one woman a drag-rope of rainbow was given, to the other a drag-rope of sunbeam,
and on these they pulled when in pain, as the Navaho woman now pulls on the rope.
Estsánatlehi&#x2019;s child was born first.<a href="#not101" class="noteref">101</a> <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i took it aside and washed it. He was glad, and laughed and made ironical motions,
as if he were cutting the baby in slices and throwing the slices away. They made for
the children two baby-baskets, both alike; the foot-rests and the back battens were
made of sunbeam, the hoods of rainbow, the side-strings of sheet lightning, and the
lacing strings of zigzag lightning. One child they covered with the black cloud, and
the other with the female rain.<a href="#not102" class="noteref">102</a> They called the children <i>S</i>&#x12d;náli (grandchildren), and they left, promising to return at the end of four days.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">296.</span> When the gods (yéi) returned at the end of four days, the boys had grown to be the
size of ordinary boys of twelve years of age. The gods said to them: &#x201c;Boys, we have
come to have a race with you.&#x201d; So a race was arranged that should go all around a
neighboring mountain, and the four started,&#x2014;two boys and two yéi. Before the long
race was half done the boys, who ran fast, began to flag, and the gods, who were still
fresh, got behind them and scourged the lads with twigs of mountain mahogany.<a href="#not103" class="noteref">103</a> <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i won the race, and the boys came home rubbing their sore backs. When the gods left
they promised to return at the end of another period of four days.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">297.</span> As soon as the gods were gone, N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i, the Wind, whispered to the boys and told them that the old ones were not such fast
runners, after all, and that if the boys would practice during the next four days
they might win the coming race. So for four days they ran hard, many times daily around
the neighboring mountain, and when the gods came back again the youths had grown to
the full stature of manhood. In the second contest the gods began to flag and fall
behind when half way round the mountain, where the others had fallen behind in the
first race, and here the boys got behind their elders and scourged the latter to increase
their speed. The elder of the boys won this race, and when it was over the gods laughed
and clapped their hands, for they were pleased with the spirit and prowess they witnessed.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">298.</span> The night after the race the boys lay down as usual to sleep; but hearing the women
whispering together, they lay awake and listened. They strained their attention, but
could not hear a word of what was uttered. At length they rose, approached the women,
and said: &#x201c;Mothers, of what do you speak?&#x201d; and the women answered: &#x201c;We speak of nothing.&#x201d;
The boys then said: &#x201c;Grandmothers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>of what do you speak?&#x201d; but the women again replied: &#x201c;We speak of nothing.&#x201d; The boys
then questioned: &#x201c;Who are our fathers?&#x201d; &#x201c;You have no fathers,&#x201d; responded the women;
&#x201c;you are yutá<i>s</i>ki (illegitimate).&#x201d; &#x201c;Who are our fathers?&#x201d; again demanded the boys, and the women
answered: &#x201c;The round cactus and the sitting cactus<a href="#not104" class="noteref">104</a> are your fathers.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">299.</span> Next day the women made rude bows of juniper wood, and arrows, such as children play
with, and they said to the boys: &#x201c;Go and play around with these, but do not go out
of sight from our hut, and do not go to the east.&#x201d; Notwithstanding these warnings
the boys went to the east the first day, and when they had travelled a good distance
they saw an animal with brownish hair and a sharp nose. They drew their arrows and
pointed them toward the sharp-nosed stranger; but before they could shoot he jumped
down into a canyon and disappeared. When they returned home they told the women&#x2014;addressing
them as &#x201c;Mother&#x201d; and &#x201c;Grandmother&#x201d;&#x2014;what they had seen. The women said: &#x201c;That is Coyote
which you saw. He is a spy for the anáye <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">300.</span> On the following day, although again strictly warned not to go far from the lodge,
the boys wandered far to the south, and there they saw a great black bird seated on
a tree. They aimed their arrows at it; but just as they were about to shoot the bird
rose and flew away. The boys returned to the <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án and said to the women: &#x201c;Mothers, we have been to the south to-day, and there we
saw a great black bird which we tried to shoot; but before we could let loose our
arrows it flew off.<span class="corr" id="xd29e6114" title="Not in source">&#x201d;</span> &#x201c;Alas!&#x201d; said the women. &#x201c;This was Raven that you saw. He is the spy of the Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale,
the great winged creatures that devour men.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">301.</span> On the third day the boys slipped off unknown to the anxious women, who would fain
keep them at home, and walked a long way toward the west. The only living thing they
saw was a great dark bird with a red skinny head that had no feathers on it. This
bird they tried to shoot also; but before they could do so it spread its wings and
flew a long way off. They went home and said to the women: &#x201c;Mothers, we have been
to the west, and we have seen a great dark bird whose head was red and bare. We tried
to shoot it, but it flew away before we could discharge our arrows.&#x201d; &#x201c;It was D<i>z</i>éso, the Buzzard, that you saw,&#x201d; said the women. &#x201c;He is the spy for Tse&#x2bb;<i>t</i>a<i>h</i>ot<i>s</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;<i>l</i>i, he who kicks men down the cliffs.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">302.</span> On the fourth day the boys stole off as usual, and went toward the north. When they
had travelled a long way in that direction, they saw a bird of black plumage perched
on a tree on the edge of a canyon. It was talking to itself, saying &#x201c;a&#x2bb;a&#x2bb;i&#x2bb;.&#x201d; They
aimed at it, but before they could let fly their arrows it spread its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>wings and tail and disappeared down the canyon. As it flew, the boys noticed that
its plumes were edged with white. When they got home they told their mothers, as before,
what they had seen. &#x201c;This bird that you saw,&#x201d; said the women, &#x201c;is the Magpie. He is
the spy for the B&#x12d;náye A<i>h</i>áni, who slay people with their eyes. Alas, our children! What shall we do to make
you hear us? What shall we do to save you? You would not listen to us. Now the spies
of the anáye (the alien gods) in all quarters of the world have seen you. They will
tell their chiefs, and soon the monsters will come here to devour you, as they have
devoured all your kind before you.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">303.</span> The next morning the women made a corncake and laid it on the ashes to bake. Then
<span class="corr" id="xd29e6145" title="Source: Yolkái">Yo<i>l</i>kaí</span> Estsán went out of the <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án, and, as she did so, she saw Yéitso,<a href="#not105" class="noteref">105</a> the tallest and fiercest of the alien gods, approaching. She ran quickly back and
gave the warning, and the women hid the boys under bundles and sticks. Yéitso came
and sat down at the door, just as the women were taking the cake out of the ashes.
&#x201c;That cake is for me,&#x201d; said Yéitso. &#x201c;How nice it smells!&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Estsánatlehi,
&#x201c;it was not meant for your great maw.&#x201d; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; said Yéitso. &#x201c;I would rather
eat boys. Where are your boys? I have been told you have some here, and I have come
to get them.&#x201d; &#x201c;We have none,&#x201d; said Estsánatlehi. &#x201c;All the boys have gone into the
paunches of your people long ago.&#x201d; &#x201c;No boys?&#x201d; said the giant. &#x201c;What, then, has made
all the tracks around here?&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh! these tracks I have made for fun,&#x201d; replied the woman.
&#x201c;I am lonely here, and I make tracks so that I may fancy there are many people around
me.&#x201d; She showed Yéitso how she could make similar tracks with her fist. He compared
the two sets of tracks, seemed to be satisfied, and went away.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">304.</span> When he was gone, Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán, the White Shell Woman, went up to the top of a neighboring hill to look
around, and she beheld many of the anáye hastening in the direction of her lodge.
She returned speedily, and told her sister what she had seen. Estsánatlehi took four
colored hoops, and threw one toward each of the cardinal points,&#x2014;a white one to the
east, a blue one to the south, a yellow one to the west, and a black one to the north.
At once a great gale arose, blowing so fiercely in all directions from the <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án that none of the enemies could advance against it.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">305.</span> Next morning the boys got up before daybreak and stole away. Soon the women missed
them, but could not trace them in the dark. When it was light enough to examine the
ground the women went out to look for fresh tracks. They found four footprints of
each of the boys, pointing in the direction of the mountain of Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>, but more than four tracks they could not find. They came to the conclusion that
the boys had taken a holy trail, so they gave up further search and returned to the
lodge.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p id="par306"><span class="parNum">306.</span> The boys travelled rapidly in the holy trail,<a href="#not93" class="noteref">93</a> and soon after sunrise, near Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>, they saw smoke arising from the ground. They went to the place where the smoke rose,
and they found it came from the smoke-hole of a subterranean chamber. A ladder, black
from smoke, projected through the hole. Looking down into the chamber they saw an
old woman, the Spider Woman,<a href="#not106" class="noteref">106</a> who glanced up at them and said: &#x201c;Welcome, children. Enter. Who are you, and whence
do you two come together walking?&#x201d; They made no answer, but descended the ladder.
When they reached the floor she again spoke to them, asking: &#x201c;Whither do you two go
walking together?&#x201d; &#x201c;Nowhere in particular,&#x201d; they answered; &#x201c;we came here because we
had nowhere else to go.&#x201d; She asked this question four times, and each time she received
a similar answer. Then she said: &#x201c;Perhaps you would seek your father?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; they
answered, &#x201c;if we only knew the way to his dwelling.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; said the woman, &#x201c;it is
a long and dangerous way to the house of your father, the Sun. There are many of the
anáye dwelling between here and there, and perhaps, when you get there, your father
may not be glad to see you, and may punish you for coming. You must pass four places
of danger,&#x2014;the rocks that crush the traveller, the reeds that cut him to pieces, the
cane cactuses that tear him to pieces, and the boiling sands that overwhelm him. But
I shall give you something to subdue your enemies and preserve your lives.&#x201d; She gave
them a charm called nayéatsos, or feather of the alien gods, which consisted of a
hoop with two life-feathers (feathers plucked from a living eagle) attached, and another
life-feather, hy&#x12d;ná b&#x12d;ltsós,<a href="#not107" class="noteref">107</a> to preserve their existence. She taught them also this magic formula, which, if repeated
to their enemies, would subdue their anger: &#x201c;Put your feet down with pollen.<a href="#not108" class="noteref">108</a> Put your hands down with pollen. Put your head down with pollen. Then your feet are
pollen; your hands are pollen; your body is pollen; your mind is pollen; your voice
is pollen. The trail is beautiful (b&#x12d;ké <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni). Be still.&#x201d;<a href="#not109" class="noteref">109</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">307.</span> Soon after leaving the house of Spider Woman, the boys came to Tse&#x2bb;yeint&#x12d;&#x2032;li (the
rocks that crush). There was here a narrow chasm between two high cliffs. When a traveller
approached, the rocks would open wide apart, apparently to give him easy passage and
invite him to enter; but as soon as he was within the cleft they would close like
hands clapping and crush him to death. These rocks were really people; they thought
like men; they were anáye. When the boys got to the rocks they lifted their feet as
if about to enter the chasm, and the rocks opened to let them in. Then the boys put
down their feet, but withdrew them quickly. The rocks closed with a snap to crush
them; but the boys remained safe on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>the outside. Thus four times did they deceive the rocks. When they had closed for
the fourth time the rocks said: &#x201c;Who are ye; whence come ye two together, and whither
go ye?&#x201d; &#x201c;We are children of the Sun,&#x201d; answered the boys. &#x201c;We come from Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>, and we go to seek the house of our father.&#x201d; Then they repeated the words the Spider
Woman had taught them, and the rocks said: &#x201c;Pass on to the house of your father.&#x201d;
When next they ventured to step into the chasm the rocks did not close, and they passed
safely on.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">308.</span> The boys kept on their way and soon came to a great plain covered with reeds that
had great leaves on them as sharp as knives. When the boys came to the edge of the
field of reeds (<i>L</i>okáadik&#x12d;<i>s</i>i), the latter opened, showing a clear passage through to the other side. The boys
pretended to enter, but retreated, and as they did so the walls of reeds rushed together
to kill them. Thus four times did they deceive the reeds. Then the reeds spoke to
them, as the rocks had done; they answered and repeated the sacred words. &#x201c;Pass on
to the house of your father,&#x201d; said the reeds, and the boys passed on in safety.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">309.</span> The next danger they encountered was in the country covered with cane cactuses.<a href="#not89" class="noteref">89</a> These cactuses rushed at and tore to pieces whoever attempted to pass through them.
When the boys came to the cactuses the latter opened their ranks to let the travellers
pass on, as the reeds had done before. But the boys deceived them as they had deceived
the reeds, and subdued them as they had subdued the reeds, and passed on in safety.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">310.</span> After they had passed the country of the cactus they came, in time, to <i>S</i>aitád, the land of the rising sands. Here was a great desert of sands that rose and
whirled and boiled like water in a pot, and overwhelmed the traveller who ventured
among them. As the boys approached, the sands became still more agitated and the boys
did not dare venture among them. &#x201c;Who are ye?&#x201d; said the sands, &#x201c;and whence come ye?&#x201d;
&#x201c;We are children of the Sun, we came from Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>, and we go to seek the house of our father.&#x201d; These words were four times said. Then
the elder of the boys repeated his sacred formula; the sands subsided, saying: &#x201c;Pass
on to the house of your father,&#x201d; and the boys continued on their journey over the
desert of sands.<a href="#not110" class="noteref">110</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">311.</span> Soon after this adventure they approached the house of the Sun. As they came near
the door they found the way guarded by two bears that crouched, one to the right and
one to the left, their noses pointing toward one another. As the boys drew near, the
bears rose, growled angrily, and acted as if about to attack the intruders; but the
elder boy repeated the sacred words the Spider <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>Woman had taught him, and when he came to the last words, &#x201c;Be still,&#x201d; the bears crouched
down again and lay still. The boys walked on. After passing the bears they encountered
a pair of sentinel serpents, then a pair of sentinel winds, and, lastly, a pair of
sentinel lightnings. As the boys advanced, all these guardians acted as if they would
destroy them; but all were appeased with the words of prayer.<a href="#not111" class="noteref">111</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">312.</span> The house of the Sun God was built of turquoise; it was square like a pueblo house,
and stood on the shore of a great water. When the boys entered they saw, sitting in
the west, a woman; in the south, two handsome young men;<a href="#not112" class="noteref">112</a> and in the north, two handsome young women. The women gave a glance at the strangers
and then looked down. The young men gazed at them more closely, and then, without
speaking, they rose, wrapped the strangers in four coverings of the sky, and laid
them on a shelf.<a href="#not113" class="noteref">113</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">313.</span> The boys had lain there quietly for some time when a rattle that hung over the door
shook and one of the young women said: &#x201c;Our father is coming.&#x201d; The rattle shook four
times, and soon after it shook the fourth time, T<i>s</i>óhanoai, the bearer of the sun, entered his house. He took the sun off his back and
hung it up on a peg on the west wall of the room, where it shook and clanged for some
time, going &#x201c;tla, tla, tla, tla,&#x201d; till at last it hung still.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">314.</span> Then T<i>s</i>óhanoai turned to the woman and said, in an angry tone: &#x201c;Who are those two who entered
here to-day?&#x201d; The woman made no answer and the young people looked at one another,
but each feared to speak. Four times he asked this question, and at length the woman
said: &#x201c;It would be well for you not to say too much. Two young men came hither to-day,
seeking their father. When you go abroad, you always tell me that you visit nowhere,
and that you have met no woman but me. Whose sons, then, are these?&#x201d; She pointed to
the bundle on the shelf, and the children smiled significantly at one another.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">315.</span> He took the bundle from the shelf. He first unrolled the robe of dawn with which
they were covered, then the robe of blue sky, next the robe of yellow evening light,
and lastly the robe of darkness. When he unrolled this the boys fell out on the floor.
He seized them, and threw them first upon great, sharp spikes of white shell that
stood in the east; but they bounded back, unhurt, from these spikes, for they held
their life-feathers tightly all the while. He then threw them in turn on spikes of
turquoise in the south, on spikes of haliotis in the west, and spikes of black rock
in the north; but they came uninjured from all these trials and T<i>s</i>óhanoai said: &#x201c;I wish it were indeed true that they were my children.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">316.</span> He said then to the elder children,&#x2014;those who lived with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>him,&#x2014;&#x201c;Go out and prepare the sweat-house and heat for it four of the hardest boulders
you can find. Heat a white, a blue, a yellow, and a black boulder.&#x201d; When the Winds
heard this they said: &#x201c;He still seeks to kill his children. How shall we avert the
danger?&#x201d; The sweat-house was built against a bank. Wind dug into the bank a hole behind
the sudatory, and concealed the opening with a flat stone. Wind then whispered into
the ears of the boys the secret of the hole and said: &#x201c;Do not hide in the hole until
you have answered the questions of your father.&#x201d; The boys went into the sweat-house,
the great hot boulders were put in and the opening of the lodge was covered with the
four sky-blankets. Then T<i>s</i>óhanoai called out to the boys: &#x201c;Are you hot?&#x201d; and they answered: &#x201c;Yes, very hot.&#x201d;
Then they crept into the hiding-place and lay there. After a while T<i>s</i>óhanoai came and poured water through the top of the sweat-house on the stones, making
them burst with a loud noise, and a great heat and steam was raised. But in time the
stones cooled and the boys crept out of their hiding-place into the sweat-house. T<i>s</i>óhanoai came and asked again: &#x201c;Are you hot?&#x201d; hoping to get no reply; but the boys
still answered: &#x201c;Yes, very hot.&#x201d; Then he took the coverings off the sweat-house and
let the boys come out. He greeted them in a friendly way and said: &#x201c;Yes, these are
my children,&#x201d; and yet he was thinking of other ways by which he might destroy them
if they were not.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">317.</span> The four sky-blankets were spread on the ground one over another, and the four young
men were made to sit on them, one behind another, facing the east. &#x201c;My daughters,
make these boys to look like my other sons,&#x201d; said T<i>s</i>óhanoai. The young women went to the strangers, pulled their hair out long, and moulded
their faces and forms so that they looked just like their brethren. Then Sun bade
them all rise and enter the house. They rose and all went, in a procession, the two
strangers last.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">318.</span> As they were about to enter the door they heard a voice whispering in their ears:
&#x201c;St! Look at the ground.&#x201d; They looked down and beheld a spiny caterpillar called Wasekede,
who, as they looked, spat out two blue spits on the ground. &#x201c;Take each of you one
of these,&#x201d; said Wind, &#x201c;and put it in your mouth, but do not swallow it. There is one
more trial for you,&#x2014;a trial by smoking.&#x201d; When they entered the house T<i>s</i>óhanoai took down a pipe of turquoise that hung on the eastern wall and filled it
with tobacco. &#x201c;This is the tobacco he kills with,&#x201d; whispered N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i to the boys. T<i>s</i>óhanoai held the pipe up to the sun that hung on the wall, lit it, and gave it to
the boys to smoke. They smoked it, and passed it from one to another till it was finished.
They said it tasted sweet, but it did them no harm.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">319.</span> When the pipe was smoked out and T<i>s</i>óhanoai saw the boys were not killed by it, he was satisfied and said: &#x201c;Now, my children,
what do you want from me? Why do you seek me?&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, father!&#x201d; they replied, &#x201c;the land
where we dwell is filled with the anáye, who devour the people. There are Yéitso and
<i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>, the Tse&#x2bb;náhale, the B&#x12d;náye A<i>h</i>áni, and many others. They have eaten nearly all of our kind; there are few left;
already they have sought our lives, and we have run away to escape them. Give us,
we beg, the weapons with which we may slay our enemies. Help us to destroy them.&#x201d;
</p>
<p id="par320"><span class="parNum">320.</span> &#x201c;Know,&#x201d; said T<i>s</i>óhanoai, &#x201c;that Yéitso who dwells at Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> is also my son, yet I will help you to kill him. I shall hurl the first bolt at him,
and I will give you those things that will help you in war.&#x201d; He took from pegs where
they hung around the room and gave to each a hat, a shirt, leggings, moccasins, all
made of pe<i>s</i> (iron or knives),<a href="#not114" class="noteref">114</a> a chain-lightning arrow, a sheet-lightning arrow, a sunbeam arrow, a rainbow arrow,
and a great stone knife or knife club (pe<i>s</i><i>h</i>ál).<a href="#not115" class="noteref">115</a> &#x201c;These are what we want,&#x201d; said the boys. They put on the clothes of pe<i>s</i>, and streaks of lightning shot from every joint.<a href="#not116" class="noteref">116</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">321.</span> Next morning T<i>s</i>óhanoai led the boys out to the edge of the world, where the sky and the earth came
close together, and beyond which there was no world. Here sixteen wands or poles leaned
from the earth to the sky; four of these were of white shell, four of turquoise, four
of haliotis shell, and four of red stone.<a href="#not117" class="noteref">117</a> A deep stream flowed between them and the wands. As they approached the stream, N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i, the Wind, whispered: &#x201c;This is another trial;&#x201d; but he blew a great breath and formed
a bridge of rainbow,<a href="#not86" class="noteref">86</a> over which the brothers passed in safety. N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i whispered again: &#x201c;The red wands are for war, the others are for peace;&#x201d; so when
T<i>s</i>óhanoai asked his sons: &#x201c;On which wands will ye ascend?&#x201d; they answered: &#x201c;On the wands
of red stone,&#x201d; for they sought war with their enemies. They climbed up to the sky
on the wands of red stone, and their father went with them.<a href="#not118" class="noteref">118</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">322.</span> They journeyed on till they came to Yága<i>h</i>oka, the sky-hole, which is in the centre of the sky.<a href="#not119" class="noteref">119</a> The hole is edged with four smooth, shining cliffs that slope steeply downwards,&#x2014;cliffs
of the same materials as the wands by which they had climbed from the earth to the
sky. They sat down on the smooth declivities,&#x2014;T<i>s</i>óhanoai on the west side of the hole, the brothers on the east side. The latter would
have slipped down had not the Wind blown up and helped them to hold on. T<i>s</i>óhanoai pointed down and said: &#x201c;Where do you belong in the world below? Show me your
home.&#x201d; The brothers looked down and scanned the land; but they could distinguish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>nothing; all the land seemed flat; the wooded mountains looked like dark spots on
the surface; the lakes gleamed like stars, and the rivers like streaks of lightning.
The elder brother said: &#x201c;I do not recognize the land, I know not where our home is.&#x201d;
Now N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i prompted the younger brother, and showed him which were the sacred mountains and
which the great rivers, and the younger exclaimed, pointing downwards: &#x201c;There is the
Male Water (San Juan River), and there is the Female Water (Rio Grande); yonder is
the mountain of <span class="corr" id="xd29e6400" title="Source: Ts&#x12d;snadz&#x12d;&#x2032;ni">Ts&#x12d;snad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni</span>; below us is Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i>; there in the west is <i>D</i>okoslí<i>d</i>; that white spot beyond the Male Water is <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa; and there between these mountains is Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>, near which our home is.&#x201d; &#x201c;You are right, my child, it is thus that the land lies,&#x201d;
said T<i>s</i>óhanoai. Then, renewing his promises, he spread a streak of lightning; he made his
children stand on it,&#x2014;one on each end,&#x2014;and he shot them down to the top of Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> (Mt. San Mateo, Mt. Taylor).

</div><p>
</p>
<p id="par323"><span class="parNum">323.</span> They descended the mountain on its south side and walked toward the warm spring at
<i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;sa<i>t</i>o.<a href="#not120" class="noteref">120</a> As they were walking along under a high bluff, where there is now a white circle,
they heard voices hailing them. &#x201c;Whither are you going? Come hither a while.&#x201d; They
went in the direction in which they heard the voices calling and found four holy people,&#x2014;Holy
Man, Holy Young Man, Holy Boy, and Holy Girl. The brothers remained all night in a
cave with these people, and the latter told them all about Yéitso.<a href="#not121" class="noteref">121</a> They said that he showed himself every day three times on the mountains before he
came down, and when he showed himself for the fourth time he descended from Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> to <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;sa<i>t</i>o to drink; that, when he stooped down to drink, one hand rested on Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> and the other on the high hills on the opposite side of the valley, while his feet
stretched as far away as a man could walk between sunrise and noon.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">324.</span> They left the cave at daybreak and went on to <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;sa<i>t</i>o, where in ancient days there was a much larger lake than there is now. There was
a high, rocky wall in the narrow part of the valley, and the lake stretched back to
where Blue Water is to-day. When they came to the edge of the lake, one brother said
to the other: &#x201c;Let us try one of our father&#x2019;s weapons and see what it can do.&#x201d; They
shot one of the lightning arrows at Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i>; it made a great cleft in the mountain, which remains to this day, and one said to
the other: &#x201c;We cannot suffer in combat while we have such weapons as these.&#x201d;
</p>
<p id="par325"><span class="parNum">325.</span> Soon they heard the sound of thunderous footsteps, and they beheld the head of Yéitso
peering over a high hill in the east; it was withdrawn in a moment. Soon after, the
monster raised his head <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>and chest over a hill in the south, and remained a little longer in sight than when
he was in the east. Later he displayed his body to the waist over a hill in the west;
and lastly he showed himself, down to the knees, over Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> in the north.<a href="#not122" class="noteref">122</a> Then he descended the mountain, came to the edge of the lake, and laid down a basket
which he was accustomed to carry.
</p>
<p id="par326"><span class="parNum">326.</span> Yéitso stooped four times to the lake to drink, and, each time he drank, the waters
perceptibly diminished; when he had done drinking, the lake was nearly drained.<a href="#not123" class="noteref">123</a> The brothers lost their presence of mind at sight of the giant drinking, and did
nothing while he was stooping down. As he took his last drink they advanced to the
edge of the lake, and Yéitso saw their reflection in the water. He raised his head,
and, looking at them, roared: &#x201c;What a pretty pair have come in sight! Where have I
been hunting?&#x201d; (<i>i.e.</i>, that I never saw them before). <span class="corr" id="xd29e6496" title="Not in source">&#x201c;</span>Yinike<i>t</i>óko! Yinike<i>t</i>óko!&#x201d;<a href="#not124" class="noteref">124</a> &#x201c;Throw (his words) back in his mouth,&#x201d; said the younger to the elder brother. &#x201c;What
a great thing has come in sight! Where have we been hunting?&#x201d; shouted the elder brother
to the giant. Four times these taunts were repeated by each party. The brothers then
heard N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i whispering quickly, &#x201c;Akó&#x2bb;! Akó&#x2bb;! Beware! Beware!&#x201d; They were standing on a bent rainbow
just then; they straightened the rainbow out, descending to the ground, and at the
same instant a lightning bolt, hurled by Yéitso, passed thundering over their heads.
He hurled four bolts rapidly; as he hurled the second, they bent their rainbow and
rose, while the bolt passed under their feet; as he discharged the third they descended,
and let the lightning pass over them. When he threw the fourth bolt they bent the
rainbow very high, for this time he aimed higher than before; but his weapon still
passed under their feet and did them no harm. He drew a fifth bolt to throw at them;
but at this moment the lightning descended from the sky on the head of the giant and
he reeled beneath it, but did not fall.<a href="#not125" class="noteref">125</a> Then the elder brother sped a chain-lightning arrow; his enemy tottered toward the
east, but straightened himself up again. The second arrow caused him to stumble toward
the south (he fell lower and lower each time), but again he stood up and prepared
himself to renew the conflict. The third lightning arrow made him topple toward the
west, and the fourth to the north. Then he fell to his knees, raised himself partly
again, fell flat on his face, stretched out his limbs, and moved no more.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">327.</span> When the arrows struck him, his armor was shivered in pieces and the scales flew
in every direction. The elder brother said: &#x201c;They may be useful to the people in the
future.&#x201d;<a href="#not126" class="noteref">126</a> The brothers then approached their fallen enemy and the younger <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>scalped him. Heretofore the younger brother bore only the name of <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni, or Child of the Water; but now his brother gave him also the warrior name of
Naí<i>d</i>ik&#x12d;<i>s</i>i (He Who Cuts Around). What the elder brother&#x2019;s name was before this we do not know;
but ever after he was called Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni (Slayer of the Alien Gods).<a href="#not127" class="noteref">127</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">328.</span> They cut off his head and threw it away to the other side of Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i>, where it may be seen to-day on the eastern side of the mountain.<a href="#not128" class="noteref">128</a> The blood from the body now flowed in a great stream down the valley, so great that
it broke down the rocky wall that bounded the old lake and flowed on. N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i whispered to the brothers: &#x201c;The blood flows toward the dwelling of the B&#x12d;náye A<i>h</i>áni; if it reaches them, Yéitso will come to life again.&#x201d; Then Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni took his
pe<i>s</i><i>h</i>ál, or knife club, and drew with it across the valley a line. Here the blood stopped
flowing and piled itself up in a high wall. But when it had piled up here very high
it began to flow off in another direction, and N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i again whispered: &#x201c;It now flows toward the dwelling of <i>S</i>a<i>s</i>nalkáhi, the Bear that Pursues; if it reaches him, Yéitso will come to life again.&#x201d;
Hearing this, Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni again drew a line with his knife on the ground, and again
the blood piled up and stopped flowing. The blood of Yéitso fills all the valley to-day,
and the high cliffs in the black rock that we see there now are the places where Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni
stopped the flow with his pe<i>s</i><i>h</i>ál.<a href="#not129" class="noteref">129</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">329.</span> They then put the broken arrows of Yéitso and his scalp into his basket and set out
for their home near Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>. When they got near the house, they took off their own suits of armor and hid these,
with the basket and its contents, in the bushes. The mothers were rejoiced to see
them, for they feared their sons were lost, and they said: &#x201c;Where have you been since
you left here yesterday, and what have you done?&#x201d; Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni replied: &#x201c;We have been
to the house of our father, the Sun. We have been to Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> and we have slain Yéitso.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ah, my child,&#x201d; said Estsánatlehi, &#x201c;do not speak thus.
It is wrong to make fun of such an awful subject.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you not believe us?&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni;
&#x201c;come out, then, and see what we have brought back with us.&#x201d; He led the women out
to where he had hidden the basket and showed them the trophies of Yéitso. Then they
were convinced and they rejoiced, and had a dance to celebrate the victory.<a href="#not130" class="noteref">130</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">330.</span> When their rejoicings were done, Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni said to his mother: &#x201c;Where does <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i><a href="#not131" class="noteref">131</a> dwell?&#x201d; &#x201c;Seek not to know,&#x201d; she answered, &#x201c;you have done enough. Rest contented.
The land of the anáye is a dangerous place. The anáye are hard to kill.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, and
it was hard for you to bear your child,&#x201d; the son replied (meaning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>that she triumphed notwithstanding). &#x201c;He lives at Bike<i>h</i>al<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n,&#x201d; she said. Then the brothers held a long council to determine what they should
do. They made two cigarette kethawns of a plant called aze<i>l</i>a<i>d</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>éhe,<a href="#not132" class="noteref">132</a> one black and one blue, each three finger-widths long; to these they attached a sunbeam
and laid them in a turquoise dish. &#x201c;I shall go alone to fight <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>,&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, &#x201c;while you, younger brother, remain at home and watch these
kethawns. If they take fire from the sunbeam, you may know that I am in great danger;
as long as they do not take fire, you may know that I am safe.&#x201d; This work was finished
at sundown.<a href="#not133" class="noteref">133</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">331.</span> Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni arose early next morning and set out alone to find <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>. He came, in time, to the edge of a great plain, and from one of the hills that bordered
it he saw the monster lying down a long way off. He paused to think how he could approach
nearer to him without attracting his attention, and in the mean time he poised one
of his lightning arrows in his hand, thinking how he should throw it. While he stood
thus in thought, Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi, the Gopher, came up to him and said: &#x201c;I greet you, my friend!
Why have you come hither?&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, I am just wandering around,&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni. Four
times this question was asked and this answer was given. Then Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi said: &#x201c;I wonder
that you come here; no one but I ever ventures in these parts, for all fear <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>. There he lies on the plain yonder.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is him I seek,&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni; &#x201c;but
I know not how to approach him.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ah, if that is all you want, I can help you,&#x201d; said
Gopher; &#x201c;and if you slay him, all I ask is his hide. I often go up to him, and I will
go now to show you.&#x201d; Having said this, Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi disappeared in a hole in the ground.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">332.</span> While he was gone Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni watched <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>. After a while he saw the great creature rise, walk from the centre in four different
directions, as if watching, and lie down again in the spot where he was first seen.
He was a great, four-footed beast, with horns like those of a deer. Soon Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi returned
and said: &#x201c;I have dug a tunnel up to <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>, and at the end I have bored four tunnels for you to hide in, one to the east, one
to the south, one to the west, and one to the north. I have made a hole upwards from
the tunnel to his heart, and I have gnawed the hair off near his heart. When I was
gnawing the hair he spoke to me and said: &#x2018;Why do you take my hair?&#x2019; and I answered,
&#x2018;I want it to make a bed for my children.&#x2019; Then it was that he rose and walked around;
but he came back and lay down where he lay before, over the hole that leads up to
his heart.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">333.</span> Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni entered the tunnel and crawled to the end. When he looked up through
the ascending shaft of which Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi had told him, he saw the great heart of <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i> beating there. He sped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>his arrow of chain-lightning and fled into the eastern tunnel. The monster rose, stuck
one of his horns into the ground, and ripped the tunnel open. Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni fled into
the south tunnel; <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i> then tore the south tunnel open with his horns, and the hero fled into the west tunnel.
When the west tunnel was torn up he fled into the north tunnel. The anáye put his
horn into the north tunnel to tear it up, but before he had half uncovered it he fell
and lay still. Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, not knowing that his enemy was dead, and still fearing
him, crept back through the long tunnel to the place where he first met Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi, and
there he stood gazing at the distant form of <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>.

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">334.</span> While he was standing there in thought, he observed approaching him a little old
man dressed in tight leggings and a tight shirt, with a cap and feather on his head;
this was <i>H</i>azaí, the Ground Squirrel. &#x201c;What do you want here, my grandchild?&#x201d; said <i>H</i>azaí. &#x201c;Nothing; I am only walking around,&#x201d; replied the warrior. Four times this question
was asked and four times a similar answer given, when Ground Squirrel spoke again
and inquired: &#x201c;Do you not fear the anáye that dwells on yonder plain?&#x201d; &#x201c;I do not know,&#x201d;
replied Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni; &#x201c;I think I have killed him, but I am not certain.&#x201d; &#x201c;Then I can
find out for you,&#x201d; said <i>H</i>azaí. &#x201c;He never minds me. I can approach him any time without danger. If he is dead
I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing.&#x201d; Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni had not watched long
when he saw <i>H</i>azaí climbing one of the horns and dancing on it. When he approached his dead enemy
he found that <i>H</i>azaí had streaked his own face with the blood of the slain (the streaks remain on
the ground squirrel&#x2019;s face to this day), and that Nas&#x12d;&#x2032;zi had already begun to remove
the skin by gnawing on the insides of the fore-legs. When Gopher had removed the skin,
he put it on his own back and said: &#x201c;I shall wear this in order that, in the days
to come, when the people increase, they may know what sort of a skin <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i> wore.&#x201d; He had a skin like that which covers the Gopher to-day. <i>H</i>azaí cut out a piece of the bowel, filled it with blood, and tied the ends; he cut
out also a piece of one of the lungs, and he gave these to Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni for his trophies.<a href="#not134" class="noteref">134</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">335.</span> When Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni came home again, he was received with great rejoicing, for his
mother had again begun to fear he would never more return. &#x201c;Where have you been, my
son, and what have you done since you have been gone?&#x201d; she queried. &#x201c;I have been to
Bike<i>h</i>al<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n and I have slain <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i>,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Ah, speak not thus, my son,&#x201d; she said; &#x201c;he is too powerful for you
to talk thus lightly about him. If he knew what you said he might seek you out and
kill you.&#x201d; &#x201c;I have no fear of him,&#x201d; said her son. &#x201c;Here is his blood, and here is
a piece of his liver. Do you not now believe I have slain him?&#x201d; Then he said: &#x201c;Mother,
grandmother, tell me, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>where do the Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale<a href="#not135" class="noteref">135</a> dwell?&#x201d; &#x201c;They dwell at <span class="corr" id="xd29e6709" title="Source: Tsé&#x2bb;b&#x12d;taï">Tsé&#x2bb;b&#x12d;<i>t</i>aï</span> (Winged Rock),&#x201d;<a href="#not136" class="noteref">136</a> she answered, &#x201c;but do not venture near them; they are fierce and strong.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">336.</span> Next morning early he stole away, taking with him the piece of bowel filled with
blood. He climbed the range of mountains where the hill of T<i>s</i>ú<i>s</i>kai rises, and travelled on till he came to a place where two great snakes lay. Since
that day these snakes have been changed into stone. He walked along the back of one
of the snakes, and then he stepped from one snake to the other and went out on the
plain that stretched to the east of the mountains, until he came close to Tsé&#x2bb;b&#x12d;<i>t</i>aï, which is a great black rock that looks like a bird. While he was walking along
he heard a tremendous rushing sound overhead, like the sound of a whirlwind, and,
looking up, he saw a creature of great size, something like an eagle in form, flying
toward him from the east. It was the male Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale. The warrior had barely time
to cast himself prone on the ground when Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale swooped over him. Thus four times
did the monster swoop at him, coming each time from a different direction. Three times
Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni escaped; but the fourth time, flying from the north, the monster seized
him in his talons and bore him off to Tsé&#x2bb;b&#x12d;<i>t</i>aï.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">337.</span> There is a broad, level ledge on one side of Tsé&#x2bb;b&#x12d;<i>t</i>aï, where the monster reared his young; he let the hero drop on this ledge, as was
his custom to do with his victims, and perched on a pinnacle above. This fall had
killed all others who had dropped there; but Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni was preserved by the life-feather,
the gift of Spider Woman, which he still kept. When the warrior fell he cut open the
bag of bowel that he carried and allowed the blood of <i>T</i>éelg&#x115;<i>t</i> to flow out over the rock, so that the anáye might think he was killed. The two young
approached to devour the body of the warrior, but he said &#x201c;Sh!&#x201d; at them. They stopped
and cried up to their father: &#x201c;This thing is not dead; it says &#x2018;Sh!&#x2019; at us.&#x201d; &#x201c;That
is only air escaping from the body,&#x201d; said the father; &#x201c;Never mind, but eat it.&#x201d; Then
he flew away in search of other prey. When the old bird was gone, Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni hid
himself behind the young ones and asked them, &#x201c;When will your father come back, and
where will he sit when he comes?&#x201d; They answered: &#x201c;He will return when we have a he-rain,<a href="#not137" class="noteref">137</a> and he will perch on yonder point&#x201d; (indicating a rock close by on the right). Then
he inquired: &#x201c;When will your mother return, and where will she sit?&#x201d; &#x201c;She will come
when we have a she-rain,<a href="#not137" class="noteref">137</a> and will sit on yonder point&#x201d; (indicating a crag on the left). He had not waited
long when drops of rain began to fall, the thunder rolled, lightning flashed, the
male Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale returned and perched on the rock which the young had pointed out.
Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni hurled a lightning arrow and the monster tumbled to the foot of Winged
Rock dead. After a while rain fell again, but there was neither thunder nor lightning
with it. While it still poured, there fell upon the ledge the body of a Pueblo woman,
covered with fine clothes and ornamented with ear pendants and necklaces of beautiful
shells and turquoise. Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni looked up and beheld the female Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale soaring
overhead (she preyed only on women, the male only on men). A moment later she glided
down, and was just about to light on her favorite crag, when Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni hurled another
lightning arrow and sent her body down to the plain to join that of her mate.
</p>
<p id="par338"><span class="parNum">338.</span> The young ones now began to cry, and they said to the warrior: &#x201c;Will you slay us,
too?&#x201d; &#x201c;Cease your wailing,&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;Had you grown up here you would have been things
of evil; you would have lived only to destroy my people; but I shall now make of you
something that will be of use in the days to come when men increase in the land.&#x201d;
He seized the elder and said to it, &#x201c;You shall furnish plumes for men to use in their
rites, and bones for whistles.&#x201d; He swung the fledgling back and forth four times;
as he did so it began to change into a beautiful bird with strong wings, and it said:
&#x201c;S&#x16d;k, s&#x16d;k, s&#x16d;k, s&#x16d;k.&#x201d; Then he threw it high in the air. It spread its pinions and
soared out of sight, an eagle. To the younger he said: &#x201c;In the days to come men will
listen to your voice to know what will be their future: sometimes you will tell the
truth; sometimes you will lie.&#x201d; He swung it back and forth, and as he did so its head
grew large and round; its eyes grew big; it began to say, &#x201c;Uwú, uwú, uwú, uwú,&#x201d; and
it became an owl. Then he threw it into a hole in the side of the cliff and said:
&#x201c;This shall be your home.&#x201d;<a href="#not138" class="noteref">138</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">339.</span> As he had nothing more to do at Tsé&#x2bb;b&#x12d;<i>t</i>aï, he determined to go home, but he soon found that there was no way for him to descend
the rock; nothing but a winged creature could reach or leave the ledge on which he
stood. The sun was about half way down to the horizon when he observed the Bat Woman
walking along near the base of the cliff. &#x201c;Grandmother,&#x201d; he called aloud, &#x201c;come hither
and take me down.&#x201d; &#x201c;T<i>s</i>&#x115;&#x2032;d&#x103;ni,&#x201d;<a href="#not139" class="noteref">139</a> she answered, and hid behind a point of rock. Again she came in view, and again he
called her; but she gave him the same reply and hid herself again. Three times were
these acts performed and these words said. When she appeared for the fourth time and
he begged her to carry him down, he added: &#x201c;I will give you the feathers of the Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale
if you will take me off this rock.&#x201d; When she heard this she approached the base of
the rock, and soon disappeared under the ledge where he stood. Presently he heard
a strange flapping sound,<a href="#not140" class="noteref">140</a> and a voice <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>calling to him: &#x201c;Shut your eyes and go back, for you must not see how I ascend.&#x201d; He
did as he was bidden, and soon after the Bat Woman stood beside him. &#x201c;Get into this
basket, and I will carry you down,&#x201d; she demanded. He looked at the large carrying-basket
which she bore on her back, and observed that it hung on strings as thin as the strings
of a spider&#x2019;s web. &#x201c;Grandmother,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I fear to enter your basket; the strings
are too thin.&#x201d; &#x201c;Have no fear,&#x201d; she replied; &#x201c;I often carry a whole deer in this basket:
the strings are strong enough to bear you.&#x201d; Still he hesitated, and still she assured
him. The fourth time that he expressed his fear she said: &#x201c;Fill the basket with stones
and you will see that I speak the truth.&#x201d; He did as he was bidden, and she danced
around with the loaded basket on her back; but the strings did not break, though they
twanged like bowstrings. When he entered the basket she bade him keep his eyes shut
till they reached the bottom of the cliff, as he must not see how she managed to descend.
He shut his eyes, and soon felt himself gradually going down; but he heard again the
strange flapping against the rock, which so excited his curiosity that he opened his
eyes. Instantly he began to fall with dangerous rapidity, and the flapping stopped;
she struck him with her stick and bade him shut his eyes. Again he felt himself slowly
descending, and the flapping against the rock began. Three times more he disobeyed
her, but the last time they were near the bottom of the cliff, and both fell to the
ground unhurt.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">340.</span> Together they plucked the two Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale, put the feathers in her basket, and got
the basket on her back. He reserved only the largest feather from one wing of each
bird for his trophies. As she was starting to leave he warned her not to pass through
either of two neighboring localities, which were the dry beds of temporary lakes;
one was overgrown with weeds, the other with sunflowers. Despite his warning she walked
toward the sunflowers. As she was about to enter them he called after her again, and
begged her not to go that way, but she heeded him not and went on. She had not taken
many steps among the sunflowers when she heard a fluttering sound behind her, and
a little bird of strange appearance flew past her close to her ear. As she stepped
farther on she heard more fluttering and saw more birds of varying plumage, such as
she had never seen before, flying over her shoulders and going off in every direction.
She looked around, and was astonished to behold that the birds were swarming out of
her own basket. She tried to hold them in, to catch them as they flew out, but all
in vain. She laid down her basket and watched, helplessly, her feathers changing into
little birds of all kinds,&#x2014;wrens, warblers, titmice, and the like,&#x2014;and flying away,
until her basket was empty. Thus it was that the little birds were created.<a href="#not141" class="noteref">141</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">341.</span> When he got home <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni said to him: &#x201c;Elder brother, I have watched the kethawns all the time you were
gone. About midday the black cigarette took fire, and I was troubled, for I knew you
were in danger; but when it had burned half way the fire went out and then I was glad,
for I thought you were safe again.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ah, that must have been the time when Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale
carried me up and threw me on the rocks,&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni. He hung his trophies
on the east side of the lodge, and then he asked his mother where Tse&#x2bb;<i>t</i>a<i>h</i>ot<i>s</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;<i>l</i>i<a href="#not142" class="noteref">142</a> dwelt. She told him he lived at <span class="corr" id="xd29e6810" title="Source: Tse&#x2bb;dezá">Tse&#x2bb;tezá&#x2bb;</span>; but, as on previous occasions, she warned him of the power of the enemy, and tried
to dissuade him from seeking further dangers. Next morning he set out to find Tse&#x2bb;<i>t</i>a<i>h</i>ot<i>s</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;<i>l</i>i, He Who Kicks (People) Down the Cliff. This anáye lived on the side of a high cliff,
a trail passed at his feet, and when travellers went that way he kicked them down
to the bottom of the precipice. Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni had not travelled long when he discovered
a well-beaten trail; following this, he found that it led him along the face of a
high precipice, and soon he came in sight of his enemy, who had a form much like that
of a man. The monster reclined quietly against the rock, as if he meditated no harm,
and Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni advanced as if he feared no danger, yet watching his adversary closely.
As he passed, the latter kicked at him, but he dodged the kick and asked: &#x201c;Why did
you kick at me?&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, my grandchild,&#x201d; said the anáye, &#x201c;I was weary lying thus, and
I only stretched out my leg to rest myself.&#x201d; Four times did Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni pass him,
and four times did the monster kick at him in vain. Then the hero struck his enemy
with his great stone knife over the eyes, and struck him again and again till he felt
sure that he had slain him; but he was surprised to find that the body did not fall
down the cliff. He cut with his knife under the corpse in different places, but found
nothing that held it to the rock until he came to the head, and then he discovered
that the long hair grew, like the roots of a cedar, into a cleft in the rock. When
he cut the hair,<a href="#not143" class="noteref">143</a> the body tumbled down out of sight. The moment it fell a great clamor of voices came
up from below. &#x201c;I want the eyes,&#x201d; screamed one; &#x201c;Give me an arm,&#x201d; cried another; &#x201c;I
want the liver,&#x201d; said a third; &#x201c;No, the liver shall be mine,&#x201d; yelled a fourth; and
thus the quarrelling went on. &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; thought Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, &#x201c;these are the children
quarrelling over the father&#x2019;s corpse. Thus, perhaps, they would have been quarrelling
over mine had I not dodged his kicks.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">342.</span> He tried to descend along the trail he was on, but found it led no farther. Then
he retraced his steps till he saw another trail that seemed to lead to the bottom
of the cliff. He followed it and soon came to the young of the anáye, twelve in number,
who had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>just devoured their father&#x2019;s corpse; the blood was still streaming from their mouths.
He ran among them, and hacked at them in every direction with his great stone knife.
They fled; but he pursued them, and in a little while he had killed all but one. This
one ran faster than the rest, and climbed among some high rocks; but Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni
followed him and caught him. He stopped to take breath; as he did so he looked at
the child and saw that he was disgustingly ugly and filthy. &#x201c;You ugly thing,&#x201d; said
Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni; &#x201c;when you ran from me so fleetly I thought you might be something handsome
and worth killing; but now that I behold your face I shall let you live. Go to yonder
mountain of Nats&#x12d;saán<a href="#not144" class="noteref">144</a> and dwell there. It is a barren land, where you will have to work hard for your living,
and will wander ever naked and hungry.&#x201d; The boy went to Nats&#x12d;saán, as he was told,
and there he became the progenitor of the Pahutes, a people ugly, starved, and ragged,
who never wash themselves and live on the vermin of the desert.<a href="#not145" class="noteref">145</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">343.</span> He went to where he had first found the children of Tse&#x2bb;<i>t</i>a<i>h</i>ot<i>s</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;<i>l</i>i. Nothing was left of the father&#x2019;s corpse but the bones and scalp. (This anáye used
to wear his hair after the manner of a Pueblo Indian.) The hero cut a piece of the
hair from one side of the head and carried it home as a trophy. When he got home there
were the usual questions and answers and rejoicings, and when he asked his mother,
&#x201c;Where is the home of the B&#x12d;náye A<i>h</i>áni, the people who slay with their eyes,&#x201d; she begged him, as before, to rest contented
and run no more risks; but she added: &#x201c;They live at Tse&#x2bb;a<i>h</i>al<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni, Rock with Black Hole.&#x201d;<a href="#not146" class="noteref">146</a> This place stands to this day, but is changed since the anáye dwelt there. It has
still a hole, on one side, that looks like a door, and another on the top that looks
like a smoke-hole.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">344.</span> On this occasion, in addition to his other weapons, he took a bag of salt with him
on his journey.<a href="#not147" class="noteref">147</a> When he came to Tse&#x2bb;a<i>h</i>al<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni he entered the rock house and sat down on the north side. In other parts of the
lodge sat the old couple of the B&#x12d;náye A<i>h</i>áni and many of their children. They all stared with their great eyes at the intruder,
and flashes of lightning streamed from their eyes toward him, but glanced harmless
off his armor. Seeing that they did not kill him, they stared harder and harder at
him, until their eyes protruded far from their sockets. Then into the fire in the
centre of the lodge he threw the salt, which spluttered and flew in every direction,
striking the eyes of the anáye and blinding them. While they held down their heads
in pain, he struck with his great stone knife and killed all except the two youngest.
</p>
<p id="par345"><span class="parNum">345.</span> Thus he spoke to the two which he spared: &#x201c;Had you grown up here, you would have
lived only to be things of evil and to destroy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>men; but now I shall make you of use to my kind in the days to come when men increase
on the earth.&#x201d; To the elder he said: &#x201c;You will ever speak to men and tell them what
happens beyond their sight; you will warn them of the approach of enemies,&#x201d; and he
changed it into a bird called Ts&#x12d;d&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>t</i>ói<a href="#not148" class="noteref">148</a> (shooting or exploring bird). He addressed the younger, saying: &#x201c;It will be your
task to make things beautiful, to make the earth happy.&#x201d; And he changed it into a
bird called <i>H</i>o<i>s</i>tó<i>d</i>i,<a href="#not149" class="noteref">149</a> which is sleepy in the daytime and comes out at night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">346.</span> When he reached home with his trophies, which were the eyes<a href="#not150" class="noteref">150</a> of the first B&#x12d;náye A<i>h</i>áni he had killed, and told what he had done, Estsánatlehi took a piece of the lung

<p class="first"><span class="parNum">347.</span> When she had finished her rejoicings he asked, &#x201c;Where shall I find <i>S</i>a<i>s</i>nalkáhi (Bear that Pursues)?&#x201d; &#x201c;He lives at Tse&#x2bb;bahásts&#x12d;t (Rock that Frightens),&#x201d; she
replied; but again she <span class="corr" id="xd29e6978" title="Source: plead">pleaded</span> with him, pictured to him the power of the enemy he sought, and begged him to venture
no more.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">348.</span> Next morning he went off to Rock that Frightens and walked all around it, without
meeting the bear or finding his trail. At length, looking up to the top of the rock,
he saw the bear&#x2019;s head sticking out of a hole, and he climbed up. The bear&#x2019;s den was
in the shape of a cross, and had four entrances. Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni looked into the east
entrance, the south entrance, and the west entrance without getting sight of his enemy.
As he approached the north entrance he saw the head of the watching bear again; but
it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>instantly withdrawn, and the bear went toward the south entrance. The hero ran round
fast and lay in wait. In a little while the bear thrust forth his head to look, and
Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni cut it off with his great stone knife.
</p>
<p id="par349"><span class="parNum">349.</span> He addressed the head, saying: &#x201c;You were a bad thing in your old life, and tried
only to do mischief; but in new shapes I shall make you of use to the people; in the
future, when they increase upon the earth, you will furnish them with sweet food to
eat, with foam to cleanse their bodies, and with threads for their clothing.&#x201d; He cut
the head into three pieces: he threw one to the east, where it became tsási, or <i>h</i>a<i>s</i>kán (<i lang="la">Yucca baccata</i>); he threw another to the west, where it became tsásitsoz (<i lang="la">Yucca angustifolia</i>); and he threw the third to the south, where it became nó<i>t</i>a (mescal). He cut off the left forepaw to take home as a trophy.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">350.</span> &#x201c;Where shall I find Tsé&#x2bb;nagahi (Travelling Stone)?&#x201d; he said after he had returned
from his encounter with Pursuing Bear and shown his trophy to his people. &#x201c;You will
find him in a lake near where Tsé&#x2bb;espai points up,&#x201d; answered Estsánatlehi; but she
implored him not to go near the lake. He did not heed her, and next morning he went
off to seek the Travelling Stone.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">351.</span> He approached the lake on the north side, while the wind was blowing from the south,
but he saw nothing of the stone. Thence he went around to the south side of the lake.
When he got here the stone scented him, rose to the surface, poised itself a moment,
and flew toward Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni as if hurled by a giant hand. Raising his lightning arrow,
he held it in the course of the stone and knocked a piece off the latter. When the
stone fell he struck another piece off with his knife. Tsé&#x2bb;nagahi now saw it had a
powerful foe to contend against; so, instead of hurling itself at him again, it fled
and Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni went in pursuit. He chased it all over the present Navaho land, knocking
pieces off it in many places<a href="#not152" class="noteref">152</a> as he followed, until at length he chased it into the San Juan River at Ts&#x12d;n<i>t</i>á<i>h</i>okata, where a point of forest runs down toward the river.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">352.</span> Travelling Stone sped down with the current and Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni ran along the bank after
it. Four times he got ahead of the stone, but three times it escaped him by dipping
deep into the river. When he headed it off for the fourth time, he saw it gleaming
like fire under the water, and he stopped to gaze at it. Then the stone spoke and
said: &#x201c;<i>S</i>awé (my baby, my darling), take pity on me, and I shall no longer harm your people,
but do good to them instead. I shall keep the springs in the mountains open and cause
your rivers to flow; kill me and your lands will become barren.&#x201d; Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni answered:
&#x201c;If you keep this promise I shall spare you; but if you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>ever more do evil as you have done before, I shall seek you again, and then I shall
not spare you.&#x201d; Tsé&#x2bb;nagahi has kept his promise ever since, and has become the Tiéholtsodi
of the upper world.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">353.</span> He brought home no trophy from the contest with Tsé&#x2bb;nagahi. It had now been eight
days since he left the house of the Sun.<a href="#not153" class="noteref">153</a> He was weary from his battles with the anáye, and he determined to rest four days.
During this time he gave his relatives a full account of his journeys and his adventures
from first to last, and as he began he sang a song:&#x2014;

<p id="par354" class="first"><span class="parNum">354.</span> There were still many of the anáye to kill; there was White under the Rock, Blue
under the Rock, Yellow under the Rock, Black under the Rock, and many yé<i>l</i>apahi, or brown giants. Besides these there were a number of stone pueblos, now in
ruins, that were inhabited by various animals (crows, eagles, etc.),<a href="#not154" class="noteref">154</a> who filled the land and left no room for the people. During the four days of rest,
the brothers consulted as to how they might slay all these enemies, and they determined
to visit again the house of the Sun. On the morning of the fourth night they started
for the east. They encountered no enemies on the way and had a pleasant journey. When
they entered the house of the Sun no one greeted them; no one offered them a seat.
They sat down together on the floor, and as soon as they were seated lightning began
to shoot into the lodge. It struck the ground near them four times. Immediately after
the last flash T<i>s</i>ápani, Bat, and <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li, Water Sprinkler, entered. &#x201c;Do not be angry with us,&#x201d; said the intruders;
&#x201c;we flung the lightning only because we feel happy and want to play with you:&#x201d; still
the brothers kept wrathful looks on their faces, until N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i whispered into their ears: &#x201c;Be not angry with the strangers. They were once friends
of the anáye and did not wish them to die; but now they are friends of yours, since
you have conquered the greatest of the anáye.&#x201d; Then, at last, T<i>s</i>óhanoai spoke to his children, saying: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>&#x201c;These people are rude; they respect no one. Heed them not. Here are seats for you.
Be seated.&#x201d; Saying this, he offered the brothers a seat of shell and a seat of turquoise;
but N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i told the brothers not to take them. &#x201c;These are seats of peace,&#x201d; he said; &#x201c;you still
want help in war. Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, take the seat of red stone, which is the warrior&#x2019;s
seat; and you, <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni, stand.&#x201d; They did as the Wind bade them.
</p>
<p id="par355"><span class="parNum">355.</span> &#x201c;My children, why do you come to me again?&#x201d; asked T<i>s</i>óhanoai, the bearer of the sun. &#x201c;We come for no special purpose; we come only to pass
away the time,&#x201d; Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni answered. Three times he asked this question and got
the same reply. When he asked for the fourth time, he added, &#x201c;Speak the truth. When
you came to me before I gave you all you asked for.&#x201d; Now it was <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni who replied: &#x201c;Oh, father! there are still many of the anáye left, and they are
increasing. We wish to destroy them.&#x201d; &#x201c;My children,&#x201d; said T<i>s</i>óhanoai, &#x201c;when I helped you before, I asked you for nothing in return. I am willing
to help you again; but I wish to know, first, if you are willing to do something for
me. I have a long way to travel every day, and often, in the long summer days, I do
not get through in time, and then I have no place to rest or eat till I get back to
my home in the east. I wish you to send your mother to the west that she may make
a new home for me.&#x201d; &#x201c;I will do it,&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni; &#x201c;I will send her there.&#x201d; But
<i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni said: &#x201c;No, Estsánatlehi is under the power of none; we cannot make promises for
her, she must speak for herself, she is her own mistress; but I shall tell her your
wishes and plead for you.&#x201d; The room they were in had four curtains which closed the
ways leading into other apartments. T<i>s</i>óhanoai lifted the curtain in the east, which was black, and took out of the room
in the east five hoops: one of these was colored black, another blue, a third yellow,
and a fourth white, the fifth was many-colored and shining. Each hoop had attached
to it a knife of the same color as itself. He took out also four great hailstones,
colored like the four first hoops. He gave all these to his sons and said: &#x201c;Your mother
will know what to do with these things.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">356.</span> When they got their gifts they set out on their homeward journey. As they went on
their way they beheld a wonderful vision. The gods spread before them the country
of the Navahoes as it was to be in the future when men increased in the land and became
rich and happy. They spoke to one another of their father, of what he had said to
them, of what they had seen in his house, and of all the strange things that had happened.
When they got near their journey&#x2019;s end they sang this song:&#x2014;

<p id="par358" class="first"><span class="parNum">358.</span> When the brothers got home they said to Estsánatlehi: &#x201c;Here are the hoops which our
father has given us, and he told us you knew all about them. Show us, then, how to
use them.&#x201d; She replied: &#x201c;I have no knowledge of them.&#x201d; Three times she thus answered
their questions. When they spoke to her for the fourth time and Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni was becoming
angry and impatient, she said: &#x201c;I have never seen the Sun God except from afar. He
has never been down to the earth to visit me. I know nothing of these talismans of
his, but I will try what I can do.&#x201d; She took the black hoop to the east, set it up
so that it might roll, and spat through it the black hail, which was four-cornered;
at once the hoop rolled off to the east and rolled out of sight. She took the blue
hoop to the south, set it up, and spat through it the blue hail, which was six-cornered.
Then the hoop rolled away to the south and disappeared. She carried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>the yellow hoop to the west, set it up, and spat through it the eight-cornered yellow
hail; the hoop rolled off to the west and was lost to sight. She bore the white hoop
to the north; spat through it the white hail, which had eleven corners, and the hoop
sped to the north until it was seen no more. She threw the shining hoop up toward
the zenith, threw the four colored knives in the same direction, and blew a powerful
breath after them. Up they all went until they were lost to sight in the sky. As each
hoop went away thunder was heard.<a href="#not155" class="noteref">155</a>
</p>
<p id="par359"><span class="parNum">359.</span> During four days after this nothing of importance happened, and no change came in
the weather. At the end of four days they heard thunder high up in the sky, and after
this there were four days more of good weather. Then the sky grew dark, and something
like a great white cloud descended from above. Estsánatlehi went abroad; she saw in
all directions great whirlwinds which uprooted tall trees as if they had been weeds,
and tossed great rocks around as if they had been pebbles. &#x201c;My son, I fear for our
house,&#x201d; she said when she came back. &#x201c;It is high among the mountains, and the great
winds may destroy it.&#x201d; When he heard this, Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni went out. He covered the house
first with a black cloud, which he fastened to the ground with rainbows; second, with
a black fog, which he fastened down with sunbeams; third, with a black cloud, which
he secured with sheet-lightning; and fourth, with a black fog, which he secured with
chain-lightning. At sunset that evening they caught a little glimpse of the sun; but
after that, continuously for four days and four nights, it was dark; a storm of wind
and hail prevailed, such as had never been seen before, and the air was filled with
sharp stones carried before the wind. The people stayed safe in the lodge, but they
could hear the noise of the great storm without. On the morning of the fifth day the
tumult ceased, and Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, going out, found that all was calm, though it was
still dark. He now proceeded to remove the coverings from the lodge and threw them
upwards toward the heavens. As the first covering, a sheet of fog, ascended, chain-lightning
shot out of it (with chain-lightning it had been fastened down). As the second covering,
a cloud, ascended, sheet-lightning came forth from it. As the third covering, a fog,
went up, sunbeams streamed from it; and as the fourth cover, a robe of cloud, floated
up, it became adorned with rainbows. The air was yet dark, and full of dust raised
by the high wind; but a gentle shower of rain came later, laying the dust, and all
was clear again. All the inmates of the lodge now came out, and they marvelled to
see what changes the storm had wrought: near their house a great canyon had been formed;
the shape of the bluffs around had been changed, and solitary pillars of rock<a href="#not156" class="noteref">156</a> had been hewn by the winds.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">360.</span> &#x201c;Surely all the anáye are now killed,&#x201d; said Estsánatlehi. &#x201c;This storm must have destroyed
them.&#x201d; But N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i whispered into Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni&#x2019;s ear, &#x201c;Sa<i>n</i> (Old Age) still lives.&#x201d; The hero said then to his mother: &#x201c;Where used Old Age to
dwell?&#x201d; His mother would not answer him, though he repeated his question four times.
At last N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i again whispered in his ear and said: &#x201c;She lives in the mountains of <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">361.</span> Next morning he set out for the north, and when, after a long journey, he reached
<i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa, he saw an old woman who came slowly toward him leaning on a staff. Her back
was bent, her hair was white, and her face was deeply wrinkled. He knew this must
be Sa<i>n</i>. When they met he said: &#x201c;Grandmother, I have come on a cruel errand. I have come
to slay you.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why would you slay me?&#x201d; she said in a feeble voice, &#x201c;I have never harmed
any one. I hear that you have done great deeds in order that men might increase on
the earth, but if you kill me there will be no increase of men; the boys will not
grow up to become fathers; the worthless old men will not die; the people will stand
still. It is well that people should grow old and pass away and give their places
to the young. Let me live, and I shall help you to increase the people.&#x201d; &#x201c;Grandmother,
if you keep this promise I shall spare your life,&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, and he returned
to his mother without a trophy.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">362.</span> When he got home N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i whispered to him: &#x201c;<i>H</i>akáz Estsán (Cold Woman) still lives.&#x201d; Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni said to Estsánatlehi: &#x201c;Mother,
grandmother, where does Cold Woman dwell?&#x201d; His mother would not answer him; but N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i again whispered, saying: &#x201c;Cold Woman lives high on the summits of <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa, where the snow never melts.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">363.</span> Next day he went again to the north and climbed high among the peaks of <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa, where no trees grow and where the snow lies white through all the summer.
Here he found a lean old woman, sitting on the bare snow, without clothing, food,
fire, or shelter. She shivered from head to foot, her teeth chattered, and her eyes
streamed water. Among the drifting snows which whirled around her, a multitude of
snow-buntings were playing; these were the couriers she sent out to announce the coming
of a storm. &#x201c;Grandmother,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;a cruel man I shall be. I am going to kill you,
so that men may no more suffer and die by your hand,&#x201d; and he raised his knife-club
to smite her. &#x201c;You may kill me or let me live, as you will. I care not,&#x201d; she said
to the hero; &#x201c;but if you kill me it will always be hot, the land will dry up, the
springs will cease to flow, the people will perish. You will do well to let me live.
It will be better for your people.&#x201d; He paused and thought upon her words. He lowered
the hand he had raised to strike her, saying: &#x201c;You speak wisely, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>grandmother; I shall let you live.&#x201d; He turned around and went home.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">364.</span> When Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni got home from this journey, bearing no trophy, Wind again whispered
in his ear and said: &#x201c;Tieí<i>n</i> (Poverty) still lives.&#x201d; He asked his mother where Poverty used to live, but she would
not answer him. It was Wind who again informed him. &#x201c;There are two, and they dwell
at Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>d</i>asd<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">365.</span> He went to Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>d</i>asd<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni next day and found there an old man and an old woman, who were filthy, clad in
tattered garments, and had no goods in their house. &#x201c;Grandmother, grandfather,&#x201d; he
said, &#x201c;a cruel man I shall be. I have come to kill you.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do not kill us, my grandchild,&#x201d;
said the old man: &#x201c;it would not be well for the people, in days to come, if we were
dead; then they would always wear the same clothes and never get anything new. If
we live, the clothing will wear out and the people will make new and beautiful garments;
they will gather goods and look handsome. Let us live and we will pull their old clothes
to pieces for them.&#x201d; So he spared them and went home without a trophy.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">366.</span> The next journey was to seek <i>D</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n, Hunger, who lived, as N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i told him, at Tló<i>h</i>a<i>d</i>askaí, White Spot of Grass. At this place he found twelve of the Hunger People. Their
chief was a big, fat man, although he had no food to eat but the little brown cactus.
&#x201c;I am going to be cruel,&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, &#x201c;so that men may suffer no more the pangs
of hunger and die no more of hunger.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do not kill us,&#x201d; said the chief, &#x201c;if you wish
your people to increase and be happy in the days to come. We are your friends. If
we die, the people will not care for food; they will never know the pleasure of cooking
and eating nice things, and they will never care for the pleasures of the chase.&#x201d;
So he spared also the <i>D</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n, and went home without a trophy.
</p>
<p id="par367"><span class="parNum">367.</span> When Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni came back from the home of Hunger, N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i spoke to him no more of enemies that lived. The Slayer of the Alien Gods said to
his mother: &#x201c;I think all the anáye must be dead, for every one I meet now speaks to
me as a relation; they say to me, &#x2018;my grandson,&#x2019; &#x2018;my son,&#x2019; &#x2018;my brother.&#x2019;&#x200a;&#x201d;<a href="#not157" class="noteref">157</a> Then he took off his armor&#x2014;his knife, moccasins, leggings, shirt, and cap&#x2014;and laid
them in a pile; he put with them the various weapons which the Sun had given him,
and he sang this song:&#x2014;

&#x201c;Put on quickly the clothes you usually wear, T<i>s</i>óhanoai is coming to see us; be ready to receive him,&#x201d; and she left the lodge, that
she might not hear them talk about the anáye.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">370.</span> When the god had greeted his children and taken a seat, he said to the elder brother:
&#x201c;My son, do you think you have slain all the anáye?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, father,&#x201d; replied the son,
&#x201c;I think I have killed all that should die.&#x201d; &#x201c;Have you brought home trophies from
the slain?&#x201d; the father questioned again. &#x201c;Yes, my father,&#x201d; was the reply; &#x201c;I have
brought back wing-feathers, and lights and hair and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>eyes, and other trophies of my enemies.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is not well,&#x201d; said T<i>s</i>óhanoai, &#x201c;that the bodies of these great creatures should lie where they fell; I shall
have them buried near the corpse of Yéitso.<span class="corr" id="xd29e7375" title="Not in source">&#x201d;</span> (He got the holy ones to carry the corpses to San Mateo and hide them under the blood
of Yéitso, and this is the reason we do not see them lying all over the land now,
but sometimes see them sticking out of the rocks.)<a href="#not159" class="noteref">159</a> He took the trophies and the armor and said: &#x201c;These I shall carry back to my house
in the east and keep them safe. If you ever need them again, come and get them.&#x201d; Promising
to come back again in four days, and meet Estsánatlehi on the top of T<i>s</i>olíhi, he departed.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">371.</span> At the end of four days Estsánatlehi went to the top of T<i>s</i>olíhi and sat down on a rock. T<i>s</i>óhanoai came, sat beside her, and sought to embrace her; but she avoided him, saying:
&#x201c;What do you mean by this? I want none of your embraces.&#x201d; &#x201c;It means that I want you
for my own,&#x201d; said the bearer of the Sun. &#x201c;I want you to come to the west and make
a home for me there.&#x201d; &#x201c;But I do not wish to do so,&#x201d; said she. &#x201c;What right have you
to ask me?&#x201d; &#x201c;Have I not given your boys the weapons to slay the alien gods?&#x201d; he inquired,
and added: &#x201c;I have done much for you: now you must reward me.&#x201d; She replied, &#x201c;I never
besought you to do this. You did not do it on my account; you did it of your own good
will, and because your sons asked you.&#x201d; He urged another reason: &#x201c;When Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni
visited me in the east, he promised to give you to me.&#x201d; &#x201c;What care I for his promise?&#x201d;
she exclaimed; &#x201c;I am not bound by it. He has no right to speak for me.&#x201d; Thus four
times she repulsed him. When he pleaded for the fifth time, saying: &#x201c;Come to the west
and make a home for me,&#x201d; she said: &#x201c;Let me hear first all you have to promise me.
You have a beautiful house in the east. I have never seen it, but I have heard how
beautiful it is. I want a house just the same built for me in the west; I want to
have it built floating on the water, away from the shore, so that in the future, when
people increase, they will not annoy me with too many visits. I want all sorts of
gems&#x2014;white shell, turquoise, haliotis, jet, soapstone, agate, and redstone&#x2014;planted
around my house, so that they will grow and increase. Then I shall be lonely over
there and shall want something to do, for my sons and my sister will not go with me.
Give me animals to take along. Do all this for me and I shall go with you to the west.&#x201d;
He promised all these things to her, and he made elk, buffalo, deer, long-tail deer,
mountain sheep, jack-rabbits, and prairie-dogs to go with her.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">372.</span> When she started for her new home the <i>H</i>a<i>d</i>á<i>h</i>onesti<i>d</i><i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb; and the <i>H</i>a<i>d</i>á<i>h</i>onige<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, two tribes of divine people,<a href="#not160" class="noteref">160</a> went with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>her and helped her to drive the animals, which were already numerous. They passed
over the <i>T</i>u&#x12d;nt<i>s</i>á range at Pé<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>i (Red Knife or Red Metal), and there they tramped the mountain down so that they
formed a pass. They halted in T<i>s</i>&#x12d;nlí valley to have a ceremony<a href="#not161" class="noteref">161</a> and a foot-race, and here the animals had become vastly more numerous. When they
crossed Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n (Black Mountain),<a href="#not162" class="noteref">162</a> the herd was so great that it tramped a deep pass whose bottom is almost on a level
with the surrounding plain; at Black Mountain all the buffaloes broke from the herd
and ran to the east; they never returned to Estsánatlehi and are in the east still.
At <i>H</i>o<i>s</i><i>t</i>ódi<i>t</i>o&#x2bb; the elks went to the east and they never returned. From time to time a few, but
not all, of the antelope, deer, and other animals left the herd and wandered east.
Four days after leaving T<i>s</i>&#x12d;nlí valley they arrived at <span class="corr" id="xd29e7451" title="Source: Dokoslíd"><i>D</i>okoslí<i>d</i></span> (San Francisco Mountain), and here they stopped to perform another ceremony. What
happened on the way from this mountain to the great water in the west, we do not know,
but after a while Estsánatlehi arrived at the great water and went to dwell in her
floating house beyond the shore. Here she still lives, and here the Sun visits her,
when his journey is done, every day that he crosses the sky. But he does not go every
day; on dark, stormy days he stays at home in the east and sends in his stead the
serpents of lightning, who do mischief.

<p class="first"><span class="parNum">375.</span> Before Estsánatlehi left, she said to Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán: &#x201c;Now, younger sister, I must leave you. Think well what you would most
like to do after I am gone.&#x201d; The younger sister replied: &#x201c;I would most like to go
back to <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa, where our people came from.&#x201d; &#x201c;Alas! you will be lonely there,&#x201d; said the
elder sister. &#x201c;You will want for some one around you to make a noise and keep you
company.&#x201d; Still, when Estsánatlehi left, Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán turned her face toward <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa. She went with the two brothers as far as <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;&#x2032;tli, and, when these stopped there, she set out alone for the mountains.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">376.</span> When she got to <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa (the San Juan Mountains), she went first to a place lying east of <i>H</i>ad<i>z</i>inaí (the Place of Emergence), named Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>l</i>a<i>d</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>t</i>éhi; in an old ruined pueblo on its side she rested during the day, and at night she
went to the top of the mountain to sleep. On the second day she went to a mountain
south of the Place of Emergence, called Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>t</i>éhi; rested on the side of the mountain during the day, and on its top at night. She
began now to feel lonely, and at night she thought of how men might be made to keep
her company. She wandered round in thought during the third day, and on the third
night she slept on top of Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>t</i>agi&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>t</i>éhi, a mountain west of <i>H</i>ad<i>z</i>inaí. On the fourth day she walked around the Place of Emergence, and wandered into
the old ruins she found there. On the fourth night she went to the top of Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>t</i>&#x12d;n&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>t</i>éz, the mountain which lies to the north of the Place of Emergence, and there she
rested, but did not sleep; for she thought all the time about her loneliness, and
of how people might be made. On the fifth day she came down to the shores of the lake
which surrounded the Place of Emergence, and built a shelter of brush. &#x201c;I may as well
stay here,&#x201d; she said to herself; &#x201c;what does it avail that I wander round?&#x201d; She sat
up late that night thinking of her lonely condition. She felt that she could not stay
there longer without companionship. She thought of her sister in the far west, of
the Twelve People, of the gods that dwelt in the different mountains, and she thought
she might do well to go and live with some of them.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">377.</span> The next morning she heard faintly, in the early dawn, the voice of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i shouting his usual &#x201c;Wu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hú,&#x201d; in the far east. Four times the cry was uttered,
each time louder and nearer. Immediately after the last call the god appeared. &#x201c;Where
did you save yourself?&#x201d; he asked the White Shell Woman, meaning, &#x201c;Where were you,
that you escaped the anáye when they ravaged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>the land?&#x201d; &#x201c;I was at Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i> with my sister,&#x201d; she said; &#x201c;but for five nights I have been all alone in these mountains.
I have been hoping that something might happen to relieve my great loneliness,&#x2014;that
I might meet some one. <i>S</i>ít<i>s</i>aí (Grandfather), whence do you come?&#x201d; He replied: &#x201c;I come from Tse&#x2bb;gíhi,<a href="#not165" class="noteref">165</a> the home of the gods. I pity your loneliness and wish to help you. If you remain
where you are, I shall return in four days and bring Estsánatlehi, the divine ones
of all the great mountains, and other gods, with me.&#x201d; When he left, she built for
herself a good hut with a storm door. She swept the floor clean, and made a comfortable
bed of soft grass and leaves.
</p>
<p id="par378"><span class="parNum">378.</span> At dawn on the fourth day after the god departed, Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán heard two voices calling,&#x2014;the voice of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, the Talking God, and the voice of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an, the House God. The voices were heard, as usual, four times, and immediately after
the last call the gods appeared. It was dark and misty that day; the sun did not rise.
Soon after the arrival of the first two, the other promised visitors came, and they
all formed themselves in a circle east of the lodge, each in the place where he or
she belonged. Thus the divine ones of Ts&#x12d;snad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni stood in the east; those of Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> (San Mateo Mountain) in the south; those of <span class="corr" id="xd29e7653" title="Source: Dokosl&#x12d;d"><i>D</i>okoslí<i>d</i></span> (San Francisco Mountain) in the west; those of <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa (San Juan Mountain) in the north. Each one present had his appropriate place
in the group. At first Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán stood in the west; but her sister, Estsánatlehi, said to her: &#x201c;No, my young
sister; go you and stand in the east. My place is in the west,&#x201d; and thus they stood
during the ceremony. Estsánatlehi brought with her two sacred blankets called <i>D</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>p&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>-naská, the Dark Embroidered, and <i>L</i>akaí-naská, the White Embroidered. <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an brought with him two sacred buckskins, and the Nalkénaa<i>z</i> (a divine couple who came together walking arm in arm) brought two ears of corn,&#x2014;one
yellow, one white,&#x2014;which the female carried in a dish of turquoise.
</p>
<p id="par379"><span class="parNum">379.</span> <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i laid the sacred blankets on the ground, and spread on top of these one of the sacred
buckskins with its head to the west. He took from the dish of the female Nalkénaa<i>z</i> the two ears of corn, handing the white ear to Tse&#x2bb;gá<i>d</i>&#x12d;na<i>t</i>&#x12d;ni A<i>s</i>iké, the Rock Crystal Boy of the eastern mountain, and the yellow ear to Na<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>tsoi A<i>t</i>é<i>t</i>, the Yellow Corn Girl of San Francisco Mountain. These divine ones laid the ears
on the buckskin,&#x2014;the yellow with its tip toward the west, the white with its tip toward
the east. <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i picked up the ears, and nearly laid them down on the buckskin with their tips to
the east, but he did not let them touch the buckskin; as he did this he uttered his
own cry of &#x201c;Wu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hú.&#x201d; Then he nearly laid them down with their tips to the south,
giving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>as he did so <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an&#x2019;s cry of &#x201c;<i>H</i>a-wa-u-ú.&#x201d; With similar motions he pointed the ears to the west and the north. Next
he raised them toward the sky, and at length laid them down on the buckskin, with
their tips to the east. He accompanied each act with a cry of his own or of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an, alternating as in the beginning. So the ears were turned in every direction, and
this is the reason the Navahoes never abide in one home like the Pueblos, but wander
ever from place to place. Over the ears of corn he laid the other sacred buckskin
with its head to the east, and then N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i, the Wind, entered between the skins. Four times, at intervals, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i raised the buckskins a little and peeped in. When he looked the fourth time, he
saw that the white ear of corn was changed to a man, and the yellow ear to a woman.
It was N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i who gave them the breath of life. He entered at the heads and came out at the ends
of the fingers and toes, and to this day we see his trail in the tip of every human
finger. The Rock Crystal Boy furnished them with mind, and the Grasshopper Girl gave
them voices. When <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i at last threw off the top buckskin, a dark cloud descended and covered like a blanket
the forms of the new pair. Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán led them into her <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án, and the assembled gods dispersed. Before he left, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i promised to return in four days.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">380.</span> No songs were sung and no prayers uttered during their rites, and the work was done
in one day. The <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án near which all these things happened still stands; but since that time it has been
transformed into a little hill. To-day (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1884) seven times old age has killed since this pair was made by the holy ones from
the ears of corn. The next very old man who dies will make the eighth time.<a href="#not166" class="noteref">166</a>
</p>
<p id="par381"><span class="parNum">381.</span> Early on the fourth morning after his departure <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i came again as he had promised, announcing his approach by calling four times as
usual. When White Shell Woman heard the first call, she aroused the young people and
said: &#x201c;Get up, my children, and make a fire. <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i is coming.&#x201d; He brought with him another couple, <i>H</i>a<i>d</i>á<i>h</i>onige A<i>s</i>iké (Mirage Boy) and <i>H</i>a<i>d</i>á<i>h</i>ones<i>t</i>i<i>d</i> A<i>t</i>é<i>t</i> (Ground-heat Girl). He gave Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán two ears of corn, saying, &#x201c;Grind only one grain at a time,&#x201d; and departed.
Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán said to the newly-arrived couple: &#x201c;This boy and girl of corn cannot marry
one another, for they are brother and sister; neither can you marry one another, for
you are also brother and sister, yet I must do something for you all.&#x201d; So she married
the boy made of corn to the Ground-heat Girl, and the Mirage Boy to the girl made
of corn. After a time each couple had two children,&#x2014;a boy and a girl. When these were
large enough to run around, this family all moved away from <i>H</i>ad<i>z</i>inaí, where they had lived four years, to Tse&#x2bb;<i>l</i>akaíia <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>(White Standing Rock). The two men were busy every day hunting rabbits, rats, and
other such animals, for on such game they chiefly lived. From these people are descended
the gens of Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni,<a href="#not167" class="noteref">167</a> House of the Dark Cliffs; so named because the gods who created the first pair came
from the cliff houses of Tse&#x2bb;gíhi, and brought from there the ears of corn from which
this first pair was made.
</p>
<p id="par382"><span class="parNum">382.</span> After they had lived thirteen years at Tse&#x2bb;<i>l</i>akaíia, during which time they had seen no sign of the existence of any people but
themselves, they beheld one night the gleam of a distant fire. They sought for the
fire all that night and the next day, but could not find it. The next night they saw
it again in the same place, and the next day they searched with greater vigilance,
but in vain. On the third night, when the distant gleam shone again through the darkness,
they determined to adopt some means, better than they had previously taken, to locate
it. They drove a forked stick firmly into the ground; one of the men got down on his
hands and knees, spreading them as wide apart as possible, and sighted the fire through
the fork of the stick. Next morning he carefully placed his hands and knees in the
tracks which they had made the night before, and once more looked through the fork.
His sight was thus guided to a little wooded hollow on the side of a far-off mountain.
One of the men walked over to the mountain and entered the little hollow, which was
small and could be explored in a few moments; but he discovered no fire, no ashes,
no human tracks, no evidence of the presence of man. On the fourth night all the adults
of the party took sight over the forked stick at the far twinkle, and in the morning
when they looked again they found they had all sighted the same little grove on the
distant mountain-side. &#x201c;Strange!&#x201d; said the man who had hunted there the day before;
&#x201c;the place is small. I went all through it again and again. There was no sign of life
there, and not a drop of water that could reflect a ray from a star or from the moon.&#x201d;
Then all the males of the family, men and boys, went to explore the little wood. Just
as they were about to return, having found nothing, Wind whispered into the ear of
one: &#x201c;You are deceived. That light shines through a crack in the mountain at night.
Cross the ridge and you will find the fire.&#x201d;<a href="#not168" class="noteref">168</a> They had not gone far over the ridge when they saw the footprints of men, then the
footprints of children, and soon they came to the camp. One party was as much rejoiced
as the other to find people like themselves in the wilderness. They embraced one another,
and shouted mutual greetings and questions. &#x201c;Whence do you come?&#x201d; said the strangers.
&#x201c;From Tse&#x2bb;<i>l</i>akaíia,&#x201d; was the response. &#x201c;And whence come you?&#x201d; asked the men of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>the White Standing Rock. &#x201c;We tarried last,&#x201d; replied the strangers, &#x201c;at <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>otsos, a poor country, where we lived on ducks and snakes.<a href="#not169" class="noteref">169</a> We have been here only a few days, and now we live on ground-rats, prairie-dogs,
and wild seeds.&#x201d; The new party consisted of twelve persons,&#x2014;five men, three women,
one grown girl, one grown boy, and two small children. The Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni people took the strangers home with them, and Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán welcomed them, saying: &#x201c;A<i>h</i>aláni <i>s</i>a<i>s</i>t<i>s</i>íni!&#x201d; (Greeting, my children!) The place where the Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni found the strangers encamped was called Tsé&#x2bb;tlana (Bend in a Canyon); so they
gave them the name of Tse&#x2bb;tláni, or Tse&#x2bb;tláni<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, and from them is descended the present gens of Tse&#x2bb;tláni in the Navaho nation.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">383.</span> The next morning after the arrival of the Tse&#x2bb;tláni, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i came once more to the lodge of the White Shell Woman; but he talked with her apart
from the others, and when he was gone she told no one what he said. In three days
he came back again; again they talked apart, and when <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i was gone she remained silent. It was her custom to sleep with one of the little
girls, who was her favorite and companion. In the morning after the second visit of
<i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i she said to this little girl: &#x201c;I am going to leave you. The gods of Tse&#x2bb;gíhi have
sent for me; but I shall not forget your people, and shall come often to watch over
them and be near them. Tell them this when they waken.&#x201d; When she had spoken she disappeared
from the sight of the little girl, and when the people woke they searched, but could
find her nowhere. They supposed she had gone to Tse&#x2bb;gíhi and tarried there a while
before she went to <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa to dwell forever in the house of White Shell, which had been prepared for
her there. The fourth night after the departure of Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán the little girl had a dream, which she related to her people in the morning.
In the vision she saw Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán, who said to her: &#x201c;My grandchild, I am going to <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa to dwell. I would take you with me, for I love you, were it not that your
parents would mourn for you. But look always for the she-rain when it comes near your
dwelling, for I shall ever be in the she-rain.&#x201d;
</p>
<p id="par384"><span class="parNum">384.</span> While at White Standing Rock the men wandered much around the country in search of
food. Some who had been to <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;<i>d</i>okó<i>n</i><i>z</i>i (Saline Water) said the latter was a better place than than that in which they lived;
that there were some porcupines there, an abundance of rats, prairie-dogs, and seed-bearing
plants; and that there were steep-sided mesa points in the neighborhood where they
might surround large game.<a href="#not170" class="noteref">170</a> After the departure of Yo<i>l</i>kaí Estsán the people all moved to <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;<i>d</i>okó<i>n</i><i>z</i>i;<a href="#not171" class="noteref">171</a> but they remained here only a few days, and then went to T<i>s</i>a&#x2bb;olgá<i>h</i>as<i>z</i>e. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>Here they planted some grains of corn from the two ears that <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i had given them long ago. This was a very prolific kind of corn; when planted, several
stalks sprouted from each grain, and a single grain, when ground, produced a large
quantity of meal, which lasted them many days.
</p>
<p id="par385"><span class="parNum">385.</span> When they had been fourteen years at T<i>s</i>a&#x2bb;olgá<i>h</i>as<i>z</i>e they were joined by another people, who came from the sacred mountain of Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>, and were therefore called Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>nao<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni, or Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>nao<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i><i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;. These were regarded as <i>d</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni, or holy people, because they had no tradition of their recent creation, and
were supposed to have escaped the fury of the alien gods by means of some miraculous
protection. They did not camp at first with the older settlers, but dwelt a little
apart, and sent often to the latter to borrow pots and metates. After a while all
joined together as one people, and for a long time these three gentes have been as
one gens and have become close relations to one another. The new-comers dug among
old ruins and found pots and stone axes; with the latter they built themselves huts.
</p>
<p id="par386"><span class="parNum">386.</span> Seven years after the arrival of the Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>nao<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni a fourth gens joined the Navahoes. The new arrivals said they had been seeking
for the Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>nao<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni all over the land for many years. Sometimes they would come upon the dead bushes
of old camps. Sometimes they would find deserted brush shelters, partly green, or,
again, quite green and fresh. Occasionally they would observe faint footprints, and
think they were just about to meet another people like themselves in the desolate
land; but again all traces of humanity would be lost. They were rejoiced to meet at
last the people they so long had sought. The new-comers camped close to the Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>nao<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni, and discovered that they and the latter carried similar red arrow-holders,<a href="#not172" class="noteref">172</a> such as the other gentes did not have, and this led them to believe that they were
related to the Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>nao<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni. The Navahoes did not then make large skin quivers such as they have in these days;
they carried their arrows in simpler contrivances. The strangers said that they came
from a place called <i>H</i>a<i>s</i>kán<i>h</i>atso (much <i lang="la">Yucca baccata</i>), and that they were the <i>H</i>a<i>s</i>kán<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, or Yucca People; but the older gentes called them <i>H</i>a<i>s</i>kán<i>h</i>atso, or <i>H</i>a<i>s</i>kan<i>h</i>atsó<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, from the place whence they came.<a href="#not173" class="noteref">173</a>
</p>
<p id="par387"><span class="parNum">387.</span> Fourteen years after the accession of the fourth gens, the Navahoes moved to K&#x12d;ntyél
(which was then a ruin), in the Chaco Canyon. They camped there at night in a scattering
fashion, and made so many fires that they attracted the attention of some strangers
camped on a distant mountain, and these strangers came down next day to find out who
the numerous people were that kindled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>so many fires. As the strangers, who were also <i>d</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni, or holy people, said they came from Na<i>h</i>opá (Place of the Brown Horizontal Streak), the Navahoes called them Na<i>h</i>opáni. They joined the tribe, camping near the <i>H</i>a<i>s</i>kán<i>h</i>atso and Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>nao<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">388.</span> It was autumn when the fifth gens was received. Then the whole tribe moved to the
banks of the San Juan River and settled at a place called Ts&#x12d;n<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;betlo<a href="#not174" class="noteref">174</a> (Tree Sweeping Water), where a peculiar white tree hangs over the stream and sweeps
the surface of the water with its long branches: there is no other tree of its kind
near by. Here they determined to remain some time and raise crops; so they built warm
huts for the winter, and all the fall and winter, when the days were fair, they worked
in the bottom-lands grubbing up roots and getting the soil ready for gardens to be
planted in the spring. The elder gentes camped farther down the stream than those
more newly arrived.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">389.</span> In those days the language which the Navahoes spoke was not the same they speak now.
It was a poor language then; it is better in these days.
</p>
<p id="par390"><span class="parNum">390.</span> When the tribe had been living six years on the banks of the San Juan, a band joined
them who came from Ts&#x12d;&#x2032;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;n<a href="#not175" class="noteref">175</a> (Black Horizontal Forest), and were named as a gens from the place whence they came.
The Navahoes observed that in this band there was a man who talked a great deal to
the people almost every morning and evening. The Navahoes did not at first understand
what this meant; but after a while they learned he spoke to his people because he
was their chief. His name was Nab&#x12d;n&#x12d;l<i>t</i>áhi.
</p>
<p id="par391"><span class="parNum">391.</span> While living at the San Juan the people amused themselves much with games. They played
mostly nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i><a href="#not76" class="noteref">76</a> in the daytime and k&#x115;s&#x12d;t<i>s</i>é<a href="#not176" class="noteref">176</a> at night. They had as yet no horses, domestic sheep, or goats. They rarely succeeded
in killing deer or Rocky Mountain sheep. When they secured deer it was sometimes by
still-hunting them, sometimes by surrounding one and making it run till it was exhausted,
and sometimes by driving them over precipices. When a man got two skins of these larger
animals he made a garment of them by tying the fore-legs together over his shoulders.
The woman wore a garment consisting of two webs of woven cedar bark, one hanging in
front and one behind; all wore sandals of yucca fibre or cedar bark. They had headdresses
made of weasel-skins and rat-skins, with the tails hanging down behind. These headdresses
were often ornamented with colored artificial horns, made out of wood, or with the
horns of the female mountain sheep shaved thin. Their blankets were made of cedar
bark, of yucca fibre, or of skins sewed together.<a href="#not177" class="noteref">177</a> Each house had, in front of the door, a long passageway, in which hung two curtains,&#x2014;one
at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>outer, the other at the inner end,&#x2014;made usually of woven cedar bark. In winter they
brought in plenty of wood at night, closed both curtains, and made the house warm
before they went to sleep. Their bows were of plain wood then; the Navahoes had not
yet learned to put animal fibre on the backs of the bows.<a href="#not178" class="noteref">178</a> Their arrows were mostly of reeds tipped with wood; but some made wooden arrows.<a href="#not180" class="noteref">180</a> The bottom-land which they farmed was surrounded by high bluffs, and hemmed in up-stream
and down-stream by jutting bluffs which came close to the river. After a time the
tribe became too numerous for all to dwell and farm on this spot, so some went up
in the bluffs to live and built stone storehouses in the cliffs,<a href="#not179" class="noteref">179</a> while others&#x2014;the Ts&#x12d;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni&#x2014;went below the lower promontory to make gardens. Later yet, some moved across
the San Juan and raised crops on the other side of the stream.<a href="#not180" class="noteref">180</a>
</p>
<p id="par392"><span class="parNum">392.</span> Eight years after the coming of the Ts&#x12d;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni, some fires were observed at night on a distant eminence north of the river,
and spies were sent out to see who made them. The spies brought back word that they
had found a party of strangers encamped at a place called <i>T</i><i>h</i>a&#x2bb;n&#x115;zá&#x2bb;, Among the Scattered (Hills). Soon after, this party came in and joined the
Navahoes, making a new gens, which was called <i>T</i><i>h</i>a&#x2bb;n&#x115;zá&#x2bb;ni. The strangers said they were descended from the <i>H</i>a<i>d</i>á<i>h</i>onige<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, or Mirage People. The remains of their old huts are still to be seen at <span class="corr" id="xd29e8170" title="Source: Tha&#x2bb;nezá&#x2bb;"><i>T</i><i>h</i>a&#x2bb;n&#x115;zá&#x2bb;</span>.
</p>
<p id="par393"><span class="parNum">393.</span> Five years after the <i>T</i><i>h</i>a&#x2bb;n&#x115;zá&#x2bb;ni were added, another people joined the tribe; but what gods sent them none
could tell. They came from a place called Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>tlá&#x2bb; (Base of Mountain), and were given the name of Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>tlá&#x2bb;ni. As they had headdresses, bows, arrows, and arrow-holders similar to those
of the <i>T</i><i>h</i>a&#x2bb;n&#x115;zá&#x2bb;ni they concluded they must be related to the latter. Ever since, these two
gentes have been very close friends,&#x2014;so close that a member of one cannot marry a
member of the other. The Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>tlá&#x2bb;ni knew how to make wicker water-bottles, carrying-baskets, and earthen pots,
and they taught their arts to the rest of the people.
</p>
<p id="par394"><span class="parNum">394.</span> Five years later, they were joined on the San Juan by a numerous band who came originally
from a place called <span class="corr" id="xd29e8201" title="Source: Thá&#x2bb;pahahalkaí"><i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha<i>h</i>alkaí</span>, White Valley among the Waters, which is near where the city of Santa Fé now stands.
These people had long viewed in the western distance the mountains where the Navahoes
dwelt, wondering if any one lived there, and at length decided to go thither. They
journeyed westward twelve days till they reached the mountains, and they spent eight
days travelling among them before they encountered the Navahoes. Then they settled
at <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>otsos and lived there twelve years, subsisting on ducks and fish,<a href="#not169" class="noteref">169</a> but making no farms. All this time they were friendly to the Navahoes and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>exchanged visits; but, finding no special evidences of relationship with the latter,
they dwelt apart. When at length they came to the San Juan to live, marriages had
taken place between members of the two tribes, and the people from Among the Waters
became a part of the Navaho nation, forming the gens of <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha. They settled at a place called Hyí&#x115;<i>t</i>y&#x12d;n (Trails Leading Upward), close to the Navahoes. Here was a smooth, sandy plain,
which they thought would be good for farming, and the chief, whose name was Góntso,
or Big Knee, had stakes set around the plain to show that his people claimed it. The
people of the new gens were good hunters, skilled in making weapons and beautiful
buckskin shirts, and they taught their arts to the other gentes.
</p>
<p id="par395"><span class="parNum">395.</span> The <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha then spoke a language more like the modern Navaho than that which the other
gentes spoke. The languages were not alike. The chief of the Ts&#x12d;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni and Góntso often visited one another at night, year after year, for the purpose
of uniting the two languages and picking out the words in each that were best. But
the words of the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha were usually the best and plainest;<a href="#not182" class="noteref">182</a> so the new language resembles the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha more than it resembles the old Navaho.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">396.</span> While the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha lived at Hyí&#x115;<i>t</i>y&#x12d;n they had always abundant crops,&#x2014;better crops than their neighbors had. Sometimes
they could not harvest all they raised, and let food lie ungathered in the field.
They built stone storehouses, something like pueblo houses, among the cliffs, and
in these stored their corn. The storehouses stand there yet. The <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha remained at Hyí&#x115;<i>t</i>y&#x12d;n thirteen years, during which time many important events occurred, as will be told,
and then they moved to Az<i>d</i>elt<i>s</i>ígi.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">397.</span> Góntso had twelve wives; four of these were from the gens of Ts&#x12d;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni, four from the gens of Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>tlá&#x2bb;ni, and four from the gens of <i>T</i><i>h</i>a&#x2bb;n&#x115;zá&#x2bb;ni. He used to give much grain from his abundant harvests to the gentes to
which his wives belonged; but, in spite of his generosity, his wives were unfaithful
to him. He complained to their relations and to their chiefs; these remonstrated with
the wives, but failed to improve their ways. At last they lost patience with the women
and said to Góntso: &#x201c;Do with them as you will. We shall not interfere.&#x201d; So the next
wife whom he detected in crime he mutilated in a shameful way, and she died in consequence.
He cut off the ears of the next transgressor, and she, too, died. He amputated the
breasts of the third wife who offended him, and she died also. He cut off the nose
of the fourth; she did not die. He determined then that cutting the nose should, in
future, be the greatest punishment imposed on the faithless wife,&#x2014;something that would
disfigure but not kill,&#x2014;and the rest of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>people agreed with him.<a href="#not183" class="noteref">183</a> But this had no effect on the remaining wives; they continued to lapse from virtue
till all were noseless. Then they got together and began to plot mischief against
their husband, Big Knee. They spoke so openly of their evil intentions that he feared
to let any of them stay in his lodge at night and he slept alone.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">398.</span> About this time the people determined to have a great ceremony for the benefit of
Big Knee; so they made great preparations and held a rite of nine days&#x2019; duration.<a href="#not184" class="noteref">184</a> During its progress the mutilated women remained in a hut by themselves, and talked
about the unkindness of their people and the vengeance due to their husband. They
said one to another: &#x201c;We should leave our people and go elsewhere.&#x201d; On the last night
of the ceremony there was a series of public exhibitions in a corral, or circle of
branches, such as the Navahoes have now on the last night of the ceremony of the mountain
chant,<a href="#not185" class="noteref">185</a> and among the different alíli, or entertainments of the night, was a dance by the
mutilated women. When their time came they entered the circle, each bearing a knife
in her hand, and danced around the central fire, peering among the spectators as if
searching for their husband; but he was hidden in the wall of branches that formed
the circle. As they danced they sang a song the burden of which was &#x201c;Pé<i>s</i>la a<i>s</i>ilá.&#x201d; (It was the knife that did it to me.) When they had finished their dance they
left the corral, and, in the darkness without, screamed maledictions at their people,
saying: &#x201c;May the waters drown ye! May the winters freeze ye! May the fires burn ye!
May the lightnings strike ye!&#x201d; and much more. Having cursed till they were tired,
they departed for the far north, where they still dwell, and now, whenever they turn
their faces to the south, we have cold winds and storms and lightning.
</p>
<p id="par399"><span class="parNum">399.</span> Not long after this memorable ceremony a number of Utes visited the Navahoes. They
came when the corn-ears were small, and remained till the corn was harvested. They
worked for the Navahoes, and when their stomachs were filled all left except one family,
which consisted of an old couple, two girls, and a boy. These at first intended to
stay but a short time after their friends had gone; but they tarried longer and longer,
and postponed their going from time to time, till they ended by staying with the Navahoes
till they died. They made particular friends with the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha, and got into the way of speaking to the latter people as they would to relations.
One of the girls, whose name was Tsá&#x2bb;y&#x12d;sk&#x12d;<i>d</i> (Sage-Brush Hill), lived to be an old woman and the mother of many children. From
her is descended the gens of Tsa&#x2bb;y&#x12d;sk&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>d</i>ni, which is so closely allied to the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha that a member of one of these gentes may not marry a member of the other.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">400.</span> Soon after the departure of the Utes the Navahoes were joined by a group of people
who, when they came to tell their story, were found to have come from <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha-<i>h</i>alkaí, and to have made wanderings similar to those of the people who first came from
that place. The new people spoke, also, the same language as the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha. For these reasons they were not formed into a new gens, but were joined to
the gens of <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha.
</p>
<p id="par401"><span class="parNum">401.</span> Some years later a large band came from the south to the settlement on the San Juan.
It consisted of Apaches, who told the Navahoes that they had left their old tribe
forever and desired to become Navahoes. They had not come to visit, they said, but
to stay. They all belonged to one gens among the Apaches,&#x2014;the gens of Tse&#x2bb;<i>z</i>in<i>d</i>iaí (Trap-dyke),<a href="#not186" class="noteref">186</a> and they were admitted into the tribe as a new gens with their old name. From the
beginning they showed a desire to associate with <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha, and now they are closely related to the latter and must not marry with them.
Another band of Apaches, which came a little later, was added to the same gens.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">402.</span> About this time there was a great famine in Zuñi, and some people from this pueblo
came to the San Juan to dwell with the Navahoes. They came first to the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha, and, although they had women in the party, they were not formed into a new
gens, but added to <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha. The gens of Zuñi was formed later.
</p>
<p id="par403"><span class="parNum">403.</span> The famine prevailed also at other pueblos, and some starving people came to the
Navahoes from an old pueblo named Klógi, which was near where the pueblo of Jemez
now stands. These formed the gens of Klógi, and made special friends of the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha.
</p>
<p id="par404"><span class="parNum">404.</span> The next accession was a family of seven adults, who came from a place called <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>h</i>ani (Near the Water). They first visited the Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>tlá&#x2bb;ni and remained, forming the gens of Tó&#x2bb;<i>h</i>ani, affiliated now with Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>tlá&#x2bb;ni.
</p>
<p id="par405"><span class="parNum">405.</span> The people who joined the Navahoes next after the Tó&#x2bb;<i>h</i>ani came from a place called <i>T</i><i>h</i>a&#x2bb;t<i>s</i>í, Among the Red (Waters or Banks), which was west of the San Juan settlement. From
their traditions it appeared that they were not a newly created people; they had escaped
in some way from the alien gods, and were for these reasons regarded as <i>d</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni, or holy people. They were divided into two gentes, <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;t<i>s</i>ini and Kaí<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, or Willow People, and for a while they formed two gentes among the Navahoes;
but in these days all traces of this division have been lost, and all their descendants
are now called, without distinction, sometimes <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;t<i>s</i>ini and sometimes Kai or Kaí<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;.
</p>
<p id="par406"><span class="parNum">406.</span> Before this time the Navahoes had been a weak and peaceable tribe; but now they found
themselves becoming a numerous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>people and they began to talk of going to war. Of late years they had heard much of
the great pueblos along the Rio Grande, but how their people had saved themselves
from the anáye the Navahoes did not know. A man named Napaíl&#x12d;n<i>t</i>a got up a war party and made a raid on a pueblo named K&#x12d;n<i>l</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>í (Red House), and returned with some captives, among whom was a girl captured by
Napaíl&#x12d;n<i>t</i>a. From her is descended the gens of K&#x12d;n<i>l</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>í, whose members are now close relations to Ts&#x12d;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni (the gens of Napaíl&#x12d;n<i>t</i>a), and cannot intermarry with the latter.

<p id="par407"><span class="parNum">407.</span> The captives from K&#x12d;n<i>l</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>í were, at first, slaves among the Navahoes;<a href="#not187" class="noteref">187</a> but their descendants became free and increased greatly, and from them came another
gens, Tl&#x12d;zi<i>l</i>áni, Many Goats, also closely related to Ts&#x12d;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni.
</p>
<p id="par408"><span class="parNum">408.</span> Next in order came a band of Apaches from the south representing two gentes,&#x2014;<i>D</i>&#x115;st<i>s</i>íni (Red Streak People), and Tlast<i>s</i>íni (Red Flat Ground People). These were adopted by the Navahoes as two separate gentes
and became close relations to the Ts&#x12d;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni.
</p>
<p id="par409"><span class="parNum">409.</span> Not long after the arrival of these Apaches some Utes came into the neighborhood
of the Navahoes, camping at a place called Tsé&#x2bb;di&#x2bb;yikáni (a ridge or promontory projecting
into the river), not far from Hyí&#x115;<i>t</i>y&#x12d;n. They had good arms of all kinds, and two varieties of shields,&#x2014;one round and
one with a crescentic cut in the top. They lived for a while by themselves, and were
at first unruly and impertinent; but in the course of time they merged into the Navahoes,
forming the gens of No<i>t</i>á or No<i>t</i>á<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, Ute People.
</p>
<p id="par410"><span class="parNum">410.</span> About the time they were incorporated by the Navahoes, or soon after, a war party
of the Utes made a raid on a Mexican settlement, somewhere near where Socorro now
is, and captured a Spanish woman. She was their slave; but her descendants became
free among the Navahoes and formed the Nakaí<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb; (White Stranger People), or Mexican gens, who cannot now intermarry with No<i>t</i>á<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;.
</p>
<p id="par411"><span class="parNum">411.</span> Góntso, or Big Knee, chief of the <span class="corr" id="xd29e8484" title="Source: Thá&#x2bb;paha"><i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha</span>, was still alive and was a famous old man; but he had become feeble and had many
ailments. There was a great ceremony practised in those days called nat<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;d, which lasted all winter,<a href="#not184" class="noteref">184</a> from harvest-time to planting-time; but the Navahoes have long ceased to celebrate
it. This ceremony was held one winter for the benefit of Big Knee at the sacred place
of <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;&#x2032;tli, the home of the War Gods. One night, while the rites were being performed,
some strangers joined the Navahoes coming from the direction of the river. Adopted
by the Navahoes, they formed the gens of <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;tlíni, and became closely allied to No<i>t</i>á<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb; and Nakaí<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;.
</p>
<p id="par412"><span class="parNum">412.</span> On another occasion during the same winter some Apaches <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>came from their country in the south to witness the ceremony of nat<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;d. Among the women of the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha was one who visited the Apache camp and remained all night there. She became
attached to an Apache youth, with whom she secretly absconded when the visitors left.
For a long time her people did not know what had become of her; but many years after,
learning where she was, some of her relations went to the Apache country to persuade
her to return. She came back an old woman, bringing her husband and a family of three
girls. The girls were handsome, had light skins and fair hair. Their grandmother,
who admired them very much, insisted that a new gens should be made of them. So they
were called <i>H</i>áltso, Yellow Bodies,<a href="#not188" class="noteref">188</a> and originated the gens of that name. Their father died an old man among the Navahoes.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">413.</span> On another night of the same winter, while the ceremony for Big Knee was going on,
two strange men, speaking the Navaho language, entered the camp. They said they were
the advanced couriers of a multitude of wanderers who had left the shores of the great
waters in the west to join the Navahoes. You shall now hear the story of the people
who came from the western ocean:&#x2014;
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">414.</span> Surrounding Estsánatlehi&#x2019;s home were four mountains, located like those at the Place
of Emergence&#x2014;one in the east, one in the south, one in the west, and one in the north.
She was in the habit of dancing on these mountains,&#x2014;on the mountain in the east to
bring clouds; on the mountain in the south, to bring all kinds of goods,&#x2014;jewels, clothing,
etc.; on the mountain in the west, to bring plants of all kinds; and on the mountain
in the north, to bring corn and animals. On these journeys for dancing she passed
from the east mountain to the south, the west, and the north mountain, the way the
sun goes; and when she was done dancing on the north mountain she retraced her course
(without crossing it) to the east; but she never completed the circle, <i>i.e.</i>, she never passed from the north directly to the east. Over the space between the
north and the east mountains she never travelled. This is the way her trail lay:&#x2014;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure fig33width" id="fig33"><img src="images/fig33.png" alt="Fig. 33. Trail of Estsánatlehi." width="578" height="514"><p class="figureHead"><span class="figNum">Fig. 33.</span> Trail of Estsánatlehi.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">415.</span> Estsánatlehi had not been long in her western home when she began to feel lonely.
She had no companions there. The people who had accompanied her thither did not stay
with her. She thought she might make people to keep her company, so one day, when
she had completed one of her dancing journeys, she sat down on the eastern mountain.
Here she rubbed epidermis from under her left arm with her right hand; she held this
in her palm and it changed into four persons,&#x2014;two men and two women,&#x2014;from whom descended
a gens to which no name was then given, but which <span class="corr" id="xd29e8550" title="Source: afterterwards">afterwards</span> (as will be told) received the name of <i>H</i>onagá&#x2bb;ni. She rubbed the epidermis with her left hand from under her right arm, held
it in her palm as before, and it became two men and two women, from whom descended
the gens afterwards known as Ki<i>n</i>aá&#x2bb;ni. In a similar way, of epidermis rubbed from under her left breast she created
four people, from whom descended the gens later known as <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;d&#x12d;t<i>s</i>íni; of epidermis from under her right breast, four persons, from whom descended the
gens called B&#x12d;<i>t</i>áni; of epidermis from the middle of her chest, the four whose descendants were called
<i>H</i>a<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>ni; and of epidermis from her back between her shoulders, the four whose descendants
were called B&#x12d;<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;ni in later times.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">416.</span> She said to these: &#x201c;I wish you to dwell near me, where I can always see you; but
if you choose to go to the east, where your kindred dwell, you may go.&#x201d; She took them
from her floating home to the mainland; here they lived for thirty years, during which
time they married and had many children. At the end of this time the Twelve People
(<i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; Naki<i>d</i>á<i>t</i>a), or rather what was left of them, appeared among Estsánatlehi&#x2019;s people and said
to them: &#x201c;We have lost our sister who kept our house for us; we have no home; we know
not where else to go; so we have come here to behold our mother, our grandmother.
You have kindred in the far east who have increased until they are now a great people.
We do not visit them, but we stand on the mountains and look at them from afar. We
know they would welcome you if you went to them.&#x201d; And many more things they told about
the people in the far east.
</p>
<p id="par417"><span class="parNum">417.</span> Now all crossed on a bridge of rainbow to the house of Estsánatlehi on the sea, where
she welcomed them and embraced them. Of the <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; Naki<i>d</i>á<i>t</i>a but ten were left, for, as has been told, they lost their sister and their younger
brother; but when they came to the home of Estsánatlehi she made for them two more
people out of turquoise, and this completed their original number of twelve. She knew
with what thoughts her children had come. She opened four doors leading from the central
chamber of her house into four other rooms, and showed them her various treasures,
saying: &#x201c;Stay with me always, my children; these things shall be yours, and we shall
be always happy together.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">418.</span> When the people went back from the house of Estsánatlehi to the mainland, all was
gossip and excitement in their camp about what they had heard of the people in the
east. Each one had a different part or version of the tale to tell,&#x2014;of how the people
in the east lived, of what they ate, of the way in which they were divided into gentes,
of how the gentes were named, and of other things about them they had heard. &#x201c;The
people are few where we live,&#x201d; they said; &#x201c;we would be better off where there are
so many.&#x201d; They talked thus for twelve days. At the end of that time they concluded
to depart, and they fixed the fourteenth day after that as the day they should leave.
</p>
<p id="par419"><span class="parNum">419.</span> Before they left, the <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; Naki<i>d</i>á<i>t</i>a and Estsánatlehi came to see them. She said: &#x201c;It is a long and dangerous journey
to where you are going. It is well that you should be cared for and protected on the
way. I shall give you five of my pets,<a href="#not189" class="noteref">189</a>&#x2014;a bear, a great snake, a deer, a porcupine, and a puma,&#x2014;to watch over you. They will
not desert you. Speak of no evil deeds in the presence of the bear or the snake, for
they may do the evil they hear you speak of; but the deer and the porcupine are good,&#x2014;say
whatever you please to say in their presence.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">420.</span> Besides these pets she gave them five magic wands. To those who were afterwards named
<i>H</i>onagá&#x2bb;ni she gave a wand of turquoise; to those who later were called Ki<i>n</i>aá&#x2bb;ni, a wand of white shell; to those who became <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;d&#x12d;t<i>s</i>íni, a wand of haliotis shell; to those who became B&#x12d;<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;ni, a wand of black stone; and to those who in later days became <i>H</i>a<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>ni, a wand of red stone. &#x201c;I give you these for your protection,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but I
shall watch over you myself while you are on your journey.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">421.</span> On the appointed day they set out on their journey. On the twelfth day of their march
they crossed a high ridge and came in sight of a great treeless plain, in the centre
of which they observed some dark objects in motion. They could not determine what
they were, but suspected they were men. They continued their journey, but did not
directly approach the dark objects; they moved among the foothills that surrounded
the plain, and kept under cover of the timber. As they went along they discerned the
dark objects more plainly, and discovered that these were indeed human beings. They
got among the foothills to one side of where the strangers were, and camped in the
woods at night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">422.</span> In spite of all the precautions taken by the travellers, they had been observed by
the people of the plain, and at night two of the latter visited their camp. The visitors
said they were K&#x12d;<i>l</i>tsói, or K&#x12d;<i>l</i>tsói<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb; (People of the <i lang="la">Bigelovia graveolens</i>); that their tribe was numerous; that the plain in which they dwelt was extensive;
and that they had watermelons getting ripe, with corn and other food, in their gardens.
The people of the west concluded to remain here a while. The second night they had
two more visitors, one of whom became enamored of a maiden among the wanderers, and
asked for her in marriage. Her people refused him at first; but when he came the second
night and begged for her again, they gave her to him. He stayed with her in the camp
of her people as long as they remained in the valley, except the last two nights,
when she went and stayed with his people. These gave an abundance of the produce of
their fields to the wanderers, and the latter fared well. When the travellers were
prepared to move, they implored the young husband to go with them, while he begged
to have his wife remain with him in the valley. They argued long; but in the end the
woman&#x2019;s relations prevailed, and the K&#x12d;<i>l</i>tsói man joined them on their journey. In the mean time four other men of K&#x12d;<i>l</i>tsói had fallen in love with maidens of the wanderers, and asked for them in marriage.
The migrating band refused to leave the girls behind, so the enamored young men left
their kindred and joined the travellers. The K&#x12d;<i>l</i>tsói tried to persuade the others to dwell in their land forever, but without avail.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">423.</span> They broke camp at last early in the morning, and travelled all day. At night a great
wind arose, and the bear would not rest, but ran around the camp all night, uneasy
and watchful. The men looked out and saw some of the K&#x12d;<i>l</i>tsói trying to approach; but the bear warded them off and they disappeared without
doing harm. In the morning it was found that the men of the K&#x12d;<i>l</i>tsói who had joined them on their journey had now deserted them, and it was supposed
that in some way they were in league with their brethren outside.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">424.</span> The second day they journeyed far, and did not make camp until after dark. As on
the previous night, the bear was awake, watchful, and uneasy all night. They supposed
he was still looking out for lurking K&#x12d;<i>l</i>tsói. Not until daybreak did he lie down and take a little sleep while the people
were preparing for the day&#x2019;s march.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">425.</span> On the third night the bear was again wakeful and on guard, and only lay down in
the morning while the people were breaking camp. &#x201c;My pet, why are you troubled thus
every night?&#x201d; said one of the men to the bear. The latter only grunted in reply, and
made a motion with his nose in the direction whence they had come.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">426.</span> On the fourth night they camped, for mutual protection, closer together than they
had camped before. The bear sat on a neighboring hill, from which he could watch the
sleepers, but slept not himself all night. As before, he took a short sleep in the
morning. Before the people set out on their march some one said: &#x201c;Let us look around
and see if we can find what has troubled our pet.&#x201d; They sent two couriers to the east
and two to the west. The former returned, having found nothing. The latter said they
had seen strange footprints, as of people who had approached the camp and then gone
back far to the west. Their pursuers, they thought, had returned to their homes.
</p>
<p id="par427"><span class="parNum">427.</span> They had now been four days without finding water, and the children were crying with
thirst. On the fifth day&#x2019;s march they halted at noon and held a council. &#x201c;How shall
we procure water?&#x201d; said one. &#x201c;Let us try the power of our magic wands,&#x201d; said another.
A man of the gens who owned the wand of turquoise stuck this wand into the ground,
and worked it back and forth and round and round to make a good-sized hole. Water
sprang from the hole. A woman of another gens crouched down to taste it. &#x201c;It is bitter
water,&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Let that, then, be your name and the name of your people,&#x201d; said
those who heard her; thus did the gens of <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;d&#x12d;t<i>s</i>íni, Bitter Water People, receive its name.
</p>
<p id="par428"><span class="parNum">428.</span> When the people had cooked and eaten food and drunk their fill of the bitter water,
they said: &#x201c;Let us try to reach yonder mountain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>before night.&#x201d; So they pushed on to a distant mountain they had beheld in the east.
When they got near the mountain they saw moccasin tracks, and knew there must be some
other people at hand. At one place, near the base of the mountain, they observed a
cluster of cottonwood trees, and, thinking there might be a spring there, they went
straight to the cottonwood. Suddenly they found themselves among a strange people
who were dwelling around a spring. The strangers greeted the wanderers in a friendly
manner, embraced them, and asked them whence they came. The wanderers told their story
briefly, and the strangers said: &#x201c;We were created at this spring and have always lived
here. It is called Mai<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;, Coyote Water (Coyote Spring), and we are the Maí<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;&#x201d; (Coyote People). The Navahoes called them Mai<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;.
</p>
<p id="par429"><span class="parNum">429.</span> The travellers tarried four days at the Coyote Spring, during which time they talked
much to their new friends, and at length persuaded the latter to join them on their
eastern journey. Before they started, the Coyote People declared that their spring
was the only water in the neighborhood; that they knew of no other water within two
days&#x2019; journey in any direction. On the morning of the fifth day they all moved off
toward the east. They travelled all day, and made a dry camp at night. The next day
at noon they halted on their way, and decided to try again the power of a magic wand.
This time the white shell was used by a member of the gens to whom it had been given,
in the same way that the turquoise wand was used before. Water sprang up. A woman
of another gens said: &#x201c;It is muddy; it may make the children sick.&#x201d; &#x201c;Let your people
then be named <i>H</i>a<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>ni, Mud People,&#x201d; cried voices in the crowd. Thus the gens of <i>H</i>a<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>, or <i>H</i>a<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>ni, was named.
</p>
<p id="par430"><span class="parNum">430.</span> The second night after leaving Coyote Spring, darkness overtook the wanderers at
a place where there was no water, and they rested there for the night. At noon on
the following day all were thirsty, and the children were crying. The people halted,
and proposed to try again the efficacy of a sacred wand. The wand of haliotis was
used this time. When the water sprang up, a woman of the Coyote People stooped first
and drank. &#x201c;It is <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;<i>d</i>okó<i>n</i><i>z</i>, alkaline (or sapid) water,&#x201d; she exclaimed. To her and her children the name <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;<i>d</i>okó<i>n</i><i>z</i>i was then given, and from them the present gens of that name is descended. Its members
may not marry with Mai<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, to whom they are related.
</p>
<p id="par431"><span class="parNum">431.</span> On the night after they found the alkaline water, they encamped once more at a place
where no water was to be found, and on the following day great were their sufferings
from thirst. At midday they rested, and begged the bearers of the black stone wand
to try the power of their magic implement. A stream of fine, clear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>water sprang up when the wand was stuck in the ground. They filled their vessels and
all drank heartily, except a boy and a girl of the gens that bore the black stone
wand. &#x201c;Why do you not come and drink before the water is all gone?&#x201d; some one asked.
The children made no reply, but stood and looked at the water. The girl had her arms
folded under her dress. They gave then to her and to her gens the name of B&#x12d;<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;ni,<a href="#not190" class="noteref">190</a> which signifies the arms under the dress.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">432.</span> The night after the B&#x12d;<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;ni was named, the travellers slept once more at a place where no water was to be
found, and next day they were very thirsty on their journey. In the middle of the
day they stopped, and the power of the red stone wand was tried. It brought forth
water from the ground, as the other wands had done, and all drank till they were satisfied;
but no member of the gentes still unnamed said anything and no name was given.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">433.</span> After this they camped two nights without water. On the second noon they arrived
at a spring in a canyon known to the Maí<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb; and called by them <i>H</i>alkaí<i>t</i>o&#x2bb;, Water of the White Valley. They journeyed no farther that day, but camped by the
water all night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">434.</span> From <i>H</i>alkaí<i>t</i>o&#x2bb; they travelled steadily for twenty-five days, until they came to a little river
near San Francisco Mountain, and west of it. During this part of the journey they
found sufficient water for their needs every day. They stopped at this river five
nights and five days and hunted. Here one man, and one only,&#x2014;whose name was Ba&#x12d;nil&#x12d;&#x2032;ni
(Looks on at a Battle),&#x2014;killed a deer, a large one, which he cut into small pieces
and distributed around so that every one might get a taste.
</p>
<p id="par435"><span class="parNum">435.</span> From the banks of this stream they came to the east side of San Francisco Mountain,
to where, beside a little peak, there is a spring that has no name. Here the travellers
stopped several days, and built around their camp a stone wall that still stands.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">436.</span> The puma belonged to the gens that bore the black stone wand, and that was afterwards
called Ki<i>n</i>aá&#x2bb;ni. While the people were camped at this spring he killed a deer. The bear sometimes
killed rabbits. The snake and the porcupine were of no use, but were a trouble instead,
since they had to be carried along. The deer ran among the crowd and did neither good
nor harm. The people lived mostly on rabbits and other small animals and the seeds
of wild plants.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">437.</span> From the spring near San Francisco Mountain they travelled to B&#x12d;<i>t</i>á<i>h</i>ot<i>s</i>i (Red Place on Top),<a href="#not191" class="noteref">191</a> and from there to Tsé&#x2bb;<i>z</i>&#x12d;nt<i>s</i>&#x12d;d&#x12d;lya. Here they held a council about the big snake. He was of no use to them, and
a great <span class="corr" id="xd29e8818" title="Source: incumbrance">encumbrance</span>. They turned him loose among the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>rocks, and his descendants are there in great numbers to this day. At Nats&#x12d;saán (Navaho
Mountain) they turned the porcupine loose, and that is why there are so many porcupines
on the Navaho Mountain now.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">438.</span> They next went to the place now called Agá<i>l</i>a,<a href="#not192" class="noteref">192</a> or Agá<i>l</i>ani, Much Wool, or Hair, and were now in the land of the Ozaí (Oraibes). They camped
all around the peak of Agá<i>l</i>a and went out hunting. Some who wore deer-masks for decoys, and went to get deer,
succeeded in killing a great number. They dressed many skins, and the wind blew the
hair from the skins up in a great pile. Seeing this, one of the <i>H</i>onagá&#x2bb;ni proposed that the place be called Agá<i>l</i>a, so this name was given to it.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">439.</span> From Agá<i>l</i>a the wanderers went to Tse&#x2bb;<i>h</i>otsóbia<i>z</i>i, Little Place of Yellow Rocks, and from there to Yótso, Big Bead. On the way they
camped often, and sometimes tarried a day or two to hunt. It was now late in the autumn.
At Yótso they saw moccasin tracks, evidently not fresh, and they said to one another:
&#x201c;Perhaps these are the footprints of the people whom we seek.&#x201d; Now there were diverse
counsels among the immigrants. Some were in haste to reach the end of the journey,
while others, as the season was late, thought it prudent to remain where they were.
Thus they became divided into two parties, one of which remained at Yótso, while the
other (containing parts of several gentes) continued the journey. Soon after the latter
was gone, those who remained at Yótso sent two messengers, and later they sent two
more, to induce the seceders to return; but the latter were never overtaken. The couriers
came to a place where the runaways had divided into two bands. From one of these the
Jicarilla Apaches are supposed to have descended. The other band, it is thought, wandered
far off and became part of the <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; Na<i>h</i>otlóni.<a href="#not193" class="noteref">193</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">440.</span> The last two messengers sent out pursued one of the fugitive bands some distance,
gave up the task, and returned to Yótso. The messengers sent first pursued the other
band. After a while they saw its camp-fires; but at such a great distance that they
despaired of overtaking it and turned toward the San Juan River, where they found
at length the long-sought Navahoes. These two messengers were the men, of whom you
have heard before, who entered the camp of Big Knee at <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;&#x2032;tli while the dance of nat<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;d was going on, and announced the approach of the immigrants from the west. (See
<a href="#par143">par. 143</a>.)
</p>
<p id="par441"><span class="parNum">441.</span> When spring-time came, the people who had remained at Yótso set out again on their
journey; but before long some of the <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;d&#x12d;t<i>s</i>íni got tired. They said that the children&#x2019;s knees were swollen, that their feet were
blistered, and that they could not go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>much farther. Soon after they said this they came to a place where a great lone tree
stood, and here they declared: &#x201c;We shall stop at this tree. After a while the people
will come here and find us.&#x201d; They remained and became the gens of Ts&#x12d;nsaká<i>d</i>ni, People of the (Lone) Tree, who are closely related to <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;d&#x12d;t<i>s</i>íni and cannot marry with the latter.
</p>
<p id="par442"><span class="parNum">442.</span> At P&#x12d;<i>n</i>b&#x12d;<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;, Deer Spring, some more of the gens of <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;d&#x12d;t<i>s</i>íni halted, because, they said, their children were lame from walking and could travel
no farther. Here they formed a new gens of Pi<i>n</i>b&#x12d;<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, People of Deer Spring,<a href="#not194" class="noteref">194</a> who are also closely related to <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;d&#x12d;t<i>s</i>íni. At this place they wanted their pet deer to leave them, but he would not go;
he remained at the spring with the people who stayed there. What finally became of
him is not known.<a href="#not195" class="noteref">195</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">443.</span> The main body of the immigrants kept on their way, and, soon after passing Deer Spring,
arrived at Hyí&#x115;<i>t</i>y&#x12d;n, where the people of <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha had their farms. Big Knee was still alive when they came; but he was very old
and feeble, and was not respected and obeyed as in former days. When <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha and <i>H</i>a<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>ni met, they traced some relationship between the two gentes: their names had much
the same meaning; their headdresses and accoutrements were alike; so the <i>H</i>a<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>ni stopped with <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha and became great friends with the latter. Yet to-day a member of one of these
gentes may marry a member of the other.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">444.</span> The bear was the last of their five pets which the immigrants retained. When they
were done their journey they said to him: &#x201c;Our pet, you have served us well; but we
are now safe among our friends and we need your services no more. If you wish you
may leave us. There are others of your kind in T<i>s</i>ú<i>s</i>kai (the Chusca Mountains). Go there and play with them.&#x201d; They turned him loose in
T<i>s</i>ú<i>s</i>kai, and bears have been numerous there ever since.
</p>
<p id="par445"><span class="parNum">445.</span> Of the people from the west, there was yet one gens&#x2014;that to which Estsánatlehi had
given the wand of turquoise&#x2014;which had no name. This nameless people did not stay long
on the banks of the San Juan before they wandered off far toward the south. One day
two men of the party, while hunting, came to a place called Tsé&#x2bb;nahap&#x12d;<i>l</i>, where there were high overhanging rocks. Here they saw the fresh prints of unshod
human feet. They followed these tracks but a short distance when they beheld a man
watching them from a rocky pinnacle. As soon as he saw that he was observed, he crouched
and disappeared. They ran quickly behind the rock on which they had seen him and again
observed him, running as fast as he could. &#x201c;Why do you fly from us?&#x201d; they shouted.
&#x201c;We mean no harm to you.&#x201d; Hearing this he stopped till they came up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>to him. Then they found he spoke the same language they did, and they addressed him
in terms of relationship. &#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d; they asked. &#x201c;In a canyon high on the
mountain,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;What do you live on?&#x201d; they queried. &#x201c;We live mostly on seeds,&#x201d;
he answered; &#x201c;but sometimes we catch wood-rats, and we raise small crops.&#x201d; &#x201c;We shall
have many things to tell one another,&#x201d; said the hunters; &#x201c;but your home is too far
for our people to reach to-day. Tell your people to come to this spot, and we shall
tell ours to come up here and meet them.&#x201d; When the hunters got home they found their
friends cooking rabbits and making mush of wild seeds. When the meal was finished
all climbed the mountain to the appointed place and found the strangers awaiting them.
The two parties camped together that night and related to one another their histories
and adventures. The strangers said that they had been created at the place where they
were all then camped only seven years previously; that they were living not far off
at a place called Na<i>t</i>anb&#x12d;<i>l</i><i>h</i>á<i>t</i>&#x12d;n, but that they came often to their natal place to pick cactus fruit and yucca fruit.
They said they called themselves Tsé&#x2bb;<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;, or Rock People; but the nameless ones gave them the name of Tse&#x2bb;nahap&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni, Overhanging Rocks People, from the place where they met. With this name they became
a gens of the Navahoes.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">446.</span> The Tse&#x2bb;nahap&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni told their new friends that they had some corn and pumpkins cached at a distance,
and they proposed to open their stores and get ready for a journey. They knew of some
Apaches to the south, whom they would all visit together. These Apaches, they said,
had some gentes of the same names as those of the Navahoes. Then they all went to
where the provisions were stored, and they made corn-cakes to use on the journey.
When they were ready they went to the south and found, at a place called T<i>s</i>óhanaa, the Apaches, who recognized them as friends, and treated their visitors so
well that the latter concluded to remain for a while.
</p>
<p id="par447"><span class="parNum">447.</span> At the end of three years the Tse&#x2bb;nahap&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni went off to join the Navahoes on the San Juan. The nameless people stayed four
years longer. About the end of that time they began to talk of leaving, and their
Apache friends tried to persuade them to remain, but without avail. When they had
all their goods packed and were ready to start, an old woman was observed walking
around them. She walked around the whole band, coming back to the place from which
she started; then she turned towards them and said: &#x201c;You came among us without a name,
and you have dwelt among us, nameless, for seven years; no one knew what to call you;
but you shall not leave us without a name. I have walked around you, and I call you
<i>H</i>onagá&#x2bb;ni (Walked-around People).&#x201d;<a href="#not196" class="noteref">196</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p id="par448"><span class="parNum">448.</span> When the <i>H</i>onagá&#x2bb;ni got back to the San Juan they found that the Tse&#x2bb;nahap&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>ni had been long settled there and had become closely related to Tlast<i>s</i>íni, <i>D</i>&#x115;st<i>s</i>íni, K&#x12d;n<i>l</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>íni, and Ts&#x12d;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni. The <i>H</i>onagá&#x2bb;ni in time formed close relationships with <i>T</i><i>h</i>a&#x2bb;n&#x115;zá&#x2bb;ni, Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>tlá&#x2bb;ni, <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>h</i>ani, and Na<i>h</i>opáni. These five gentes are now all the same as one gens, and no member of one may
marry a member of another.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p id="par449"><span class="parNum">449.</span> It happened about this time, while some of the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha were sojourning at Agá<i>l</i>a, that they sent two children, one night, to a spring to get water. The children
carried out with them two wicker bottles, but returned with four. &#x201c;Where did you get
these other bottles?&#x201d; the parents inquired. &#x201c;We took them away from two little girls
whom we met at the spring,&#x201d; answered the children. &#x201c;Why did you do this, and who are
the girls?&#x201d; said the elders. &#x201c;We do not know. They are strangers,&#x201d; said the little
ones. The parents at once set out for the spring to find the strange children and
restore the stolen bottles to them; but on their way they met the little girls coming
toward the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha camp, and asked them who they were. The strange children replied: &#x201c;We belong
to a band of wanderers who are encamped on yonder mountain. They sent us two together
to find water.&#x201d; &#x201c;Then we shall give you a name,&#x201d; said the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha; &#x201c;we shall call you <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;ba<i>z</i>naá<i>z</i>i,&#x201d; Two Come Together for Water. The <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha brought the little girls to their hut and bade them be seated. &#x201c;Stay with us,&#x201d;
they said. &#x201c;You are too weak and little to carry the water so far. We will send some
of our young men to carry it for you.&#x201d; When the young men found the camp of the strangers
they invited the latter to visit them. The <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha welcomed the new-comers as friends, and told them they had already a name for
them, <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;ba<i>z</i>naá<i>z</i>i. Under this name they became united to the Navahoes as a new gens, and they are
now closely affiliated with <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha.<a href="#not197" class="noteref">197</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">450.</span> Shortly after the coming of <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;ba<i>z</i>naá<i>z</i>i, the Navahoes were joined by a band of Apaches, who were adopted by <span class="corr" id="xd29e9090" title="Source: Thá&#x2bb;paha"><i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha</span> and not formed into a new gens. About the same time a band of Pah Utes came and were
likewise adopted by <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha. A little later some more Apaches arrived and became a part of <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha; but, although no distinct name is now given them, their descendants are known
among the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha as a people of different origin from the others.
</p>
<p id="par451"><span class="parNum">451.</span> Another party of Apaches, who came afterwards, dwelt a long time among the <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;<i>d</i>okó<i>z</i>i; but later they abode with the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha, and became closely related to the latter. They are still affiliated with <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha, but these call them <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;<i>d</i>okó<i>z</i>i.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p id="par452"><span class="parNum">452.</span> Some years passed before the next accession was made. This was another party of Zuñi
Indians, and they were admitted into the gens of the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha. Soon after them came the Zuñi People, who were at last formed into a separate
gens,&#x2014;that of Nana<i>s</i><i>t</i>&#x115;&#x2032;<i>z</i>i<i>n</i>. This is the Navaho name for all the Zuñians, and means Black Horizontal Stripe Aliens.<a href="#not198" class="noteref">198</a> All these people deserted the Zuñi villages on account of scarcity of food.
</p>
<p id="par453"><span class="parNum">453.</span> A new people, with painted faces, came from the west about the same time as those
who formed the gens of Zuñi, or a little later. They are supposed to have been a part
of the tribe now called Mohaves on the banks of the Colorado. They bore the name of
<i>D</i>ild<i>z</i>éhi, and their descendants now form a gens of that name among the Navahoes. At first
they affiliated with Nana<i>s</i><i>t</i>&#x115;&#x2032;<i>z</i>i<i>n</i>; but to-day they are better friends with <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;t<i>s</i>ini than with Nana<i>s</i><i>t</i>&#x115;&#x2032;<i>z</i>i<i>n</i>.
</p>
<p id="par454"><span class="parNum">454.</span> A war-party, consisting of members of different gentes, was now organized among the
Navahoes to attack a pueblo called <i>S</i>aíbe<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an, House Made of Sand. At that place they captured two girls and brought them home
as slaves. There was a salt lake near their old home, and the girls belonged to a
gens of Salt People there. So their numerous descendants now among the Navahoes form
the gens of Á<i>s</i>ihi, or Salt. The captives were taken by members of the Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni, hence Á<i>s</i>ihi and Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni are now affiliated.
</p>
<p id="par455"><span class="parNum">455.</span> Then a war party was gotten up to attack the people of Jemez pueblo. On this raid
one of the Tlast<i>s</i>íni captured a Jemez girl, but sold her to one of the Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni. She was the progenitor of the gens of Mai<i>d</i>&#x115;<i>s</i>k&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>ni, People of Wolf Pass (<i>i.e.</i>, Jemez), which is now affiliated with Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">456.</span> After the Navahoes attacked <i>S</i>aíbe<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an there was a famine there, and some of the people abandoned their homes and joined
the Navahoes. They said that in their pueblo there was a gens of <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha, and hearing there was such a gens among the Navahoes they came to join it.
Therefore they sought <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha till they found it and became a part of it.
</p>
<p id="par457"><span class="parNum">457.</span> There came once a party of seven people from a place called Tse&#x2bb;yana<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;ni, Horizontal Water under Cliffs, to pay a short visit to the Navahoes; but from
time to time they delayed their departure, and at last stayed forever with the Navahoes.
They formed the gens of Tse&#x2bb;yana<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;ni, which is now extinct.
</p>
<p id="par458"><span class="parNum">458.</span> The people whom Estsánatlehi created from the skin under her right arm, and to whom
she gave the wand of white shell, was called, after they came among the Navahoes,
Ki<i>n</i>aá&#x2bb;ni, High Stone House People; not because they built or dwelt in such a house, but
because they lived near one.<a href="#not199" class="noteref">199</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p id="par459"><span class="parNum">459.</span> When the <span class="corr" id="xd29e9258" title="Source: B&#x12d;tá&#x2bb;ni">B&#x12d;<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;ni</span> were encamped at a place called <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;tso, or Big Water, near the Carrizo Mountains, a man and a woman came up out of
the water and joined them. From this pair is descended the gens of <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;tsoni, People of the Big Water, which is affiliated with B&#x12d;<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;ni.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">460.</span> Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani,<a href="#not201" class="noteref">201</a> He Who Teaches Himself, lived, with his relations, near the mountain of Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>. The few people who lived there used to wander continually around the mountain, hence
its name, Encircled Mountain. Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani delighted in gambling, but was not successful. He lost at game, not only all his
own goods, but all the goods and jewels of his relations, until there was only one
article of value left&#x2014;a necklace consisting of several strings of white beads. His
parents and brother lived in one lodge; his grandmother and niece lived in another,
a little distance from the first. When the gambler had parted with everything except
the necklace, his brother took this to the lodge of his grandmother and gave it to
her, saying: &#x201c;My brother has gambled away everything save this. Should he lose this
at game, it is the last thing he will ever lose, for then I shall kill him.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">461.</span> Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani did not spend all his time gambling; sometimes he hunted for wood-rats and rabbits
in the mountains. The day the necklace was brought, in returning from his hunt, he
came to the house of his grandmother and saw the necklace hanging up there. &#x201c;Why is
this here?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;It is put here for safe-keeping,&#x201d; replied his niece. &#x201c;Your
brother values it and has asked us to take care of it. If you lose it in gambling,
he has threatened to kill you. I have heard the counsels of the family about you.
They are tired of you. If you lose this necklace at play, it is the last thing you
will ever lose.&#x201d; On hearing this he only said to his niece, &#x201c;I must think what I shall
do,&#x201d; and he lay down to rest.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">462.</span> Next morning he rose early, made his breakfast of wood-rats, and went out to hunt,
travelling toward the east. He stopped at one place, set fall-traps for wood-rats,
and slept there all night. During the night he pondered on many plans. He thought
at first he would go farther east and leave his people forever; but again he thought,
&#x201c;Who will hunt wood-rats for my niece when I am gone?&#x201d; and he went back to her lodge
and gave her all the little animals he had killed.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">463.</span> In the morning he breakfasted again on wood-rats, and said <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>to himself: &#x201c;I shall go to-day to the south and never return.&#x201d; Such was his intention
as he went on his way. He travelled to the south, and spent the night out again; but
in the morning he changed his mind, and came back to his niece with wood-rats and
rabbits and the seeds of wild plants that he had gathered. The women cooked some of
the wood-rats for his supper that night. When he lay down he thought of his brother&#x2019;s
threats, and made plans again for running away. He had not touched the beads, though
he longed to take them.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">464.</span> Next morning he went to the west, hunted there all day, and camped out at night as
before; but again he could not make up his mind to leave his people, though he thought
much about it; so he returned to his niece with such food as he had been able to get
for her, and slept in the lodge that night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">465.</span> On the following day he went to the north and hunted. He slept little at night while
camping out, for his mind was filled with sad thoughts. &#x201c;My brother disowns me,&#x201d; he
said to himself. &#x201c;My parents refuse me shelter. My niece, whom I love most, barely
looks at me. I shall never go back again.&#x201d; Yet, for all these words, when morning
came he returned to the lodge.<a href="#not19" class="noteref">19</a>
</p>
<p id="par466"><span class="parNum">466.</span> By this time he was very poor, and so were his grandmother and niece. His sandals,
made of grass and yucca-fibre, were worn through, and the blanket made of yucca-fibre
and cedar-bark, which covered his back, was ragged.<a href="#not177" class="noteref">177</a> But the people in the other lodge were better off. They gave the grandmother and
niece food at times; but always watched these closely when they came for food, lest
they should carry off something to give the gambler. &#x201c;Let him live,&#x201d; said his parents,
&#x201c;on wood-rats and rabbits as well as he can.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">467.</span> The night after he returned from his hunt to the north he slept little, but spent
the time mostly in thinking and making plans. What these plans were you shall soon
know, for the next day he began to carry them out. His thought for his niece was now
the only thing that made him care to stay at home.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">468.</span> In the morning after this night of thought he asked his niece to roast for him four
wood-rats; he tied these together and set out for the San Juan River. When he got
to the banks of the river he examined a number of cottonwood trees until he found
one that suited him. He burned this down and burned it off square at the base. He
kept his fire from burning up the whole trunk by applying mud above the place to be
burned. His plan was to make a hollow vessel by which he could go down the San Juan
River. It was his own plan. He had never heard of such a thing before. The Navahoes
had never anything better than rafts, and these were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>good only to cross the river. He lay down beside the log to see where he should divide
it, for he had planned to make the vessel a little longer than himself, and he burned
the log across at the place selected. All this he did in one day, and then he went
home, collecting rats on the way; but he told his niece nothing about the log. He
slept that night in the lodge.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">469.</span> He went back, next morning, to his log on the banks of the San Juan, and spent the
day making the log hollow by means of fire, beginning at the butt end. He succeeded
in doing only a part of this work in one day. It took him four days to burn the hole
through from one end of the log to the other and to make it wide enough to hold his
body. At the end of each day&#x2019;s work he returned to his grandmother&#x2019;s lodge, and got
wood-rats and rabbits on his way home.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">470.</span> The next day, after the hole was finished, was spent in making and inserting plugs.
He moistened a lot of shredded cedar-bark and pounded it between stones so as to make
a soft mass. He shoved a large piece of this in at the butt end and rammed it down
to the tip end. In burning out the log, he had burned, where the tree branched, four
holes which he did not need, and these he filled with plugs of the cedar-bark. He
prepared another plug to be rammed into the butt from the inside, after he entered
the log, and when this was finished he went home to his grandmother&#x2019;s house, collecting
wood-rats from his traps as he went.
</p>
<p id="par471"><span class="parNum">471.</span> The next morning his niece cooked several wood-rats and ground for him a good quantity&#x2014;as
much as could be held in two hands&#x2014;of the seeds of tlo&#x2bb;tsózi (<i lang="la">Sporobolus cryptandrus</i>). This meal she put in a bag of wood-rat skins sewed together. Thus provided he went
back to his log. He put the provisions into the hole and then proceeded to enter,
in person, to see if the log was sound and the hole big enough. He entered, head foremost,
and crawled inwards until half of his chest was in the log, when he heard a voice
crying, &#x201c;Wu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hú!&#x201d;<a href="#not26" class="noteref">26</a> and he came out to see who called. He looked in every direction and examined the
ground for tracks, but seeing no signs of any intruder he proceeded again to enter
the log. This time he got in as far as his waist, when again he heard the cry of &#x201c;Wu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hú,&#x201d;
but louder and nearer than before. Again he came out of the log and looked around
farther and more carefully than he did the first time, going in his search to the
margin of the river; but he saw no one, found no tracks, and returned to his log.
On the next trial he entered as far as his knees, when for the third time the cry
sounded, and he crept out once more to find whence it came. He searched farther, longer,
and more closely than on either of the previous occasions, but without success, and
he went back to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>enter the log again. On the fourth trial, when he had entered as far as his feet,
he heard the cry loud and near, and he felt some one shaking the log. He crept out
for the fourth time and beheld <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, the Talking God,<a href="#not73" class="noteref">73</a> standing over him.
</p>
<p id="par472"><span class="parNum">472.</span> <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i did not speak at first, but told the man by signs that he must not get into the
log, that he would surely be drowned if he did, and that he must go home. Then <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i walked off a distance from the log and motioned to the Navaho to come to him. When
Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani came near the god, the latter spoke, saying: &#x201c;My grandchild, why are you doing
all this work? Where do you intend to go with this log?&#x201d; The man then told the god
all his sad story, and ended by saying: &#x201c;I am an outcast. I wish to get far away from
my people. Take pity on me. Stop me not, but let me go in this log as far as the waters
of the Old Age River (San Juan) will bear me.&#x201d; <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i replied: &#x201c;No. You must not attempt to go into that log. You will surely be drowned
if you do. I shall not allow you.&#x201d; Four times Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani pleaded, and four times the god denied him. Then the god said: &#x201c;Have you any precious
stones?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; replied the man. &#x201c;Have you white shell beads? Have you turquoise?&#x201d;
and thus the god went on asking him, one by one, if he had all the original eighteen
sacred things<a href="#not202" class="noteref">202</a> that must be offered to the gods to gain their favor. To each of his questions the
man replied &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; although he had none of these things, and owned nothing but the
rags that covered him. &#x201c;It is well,&#x201d; said the god. &#x201c;You need not enter that log to
make your journey. Go home and stay there for four nights. At daylight, after the
fourth night, you may expect to see me again. Have yourself and your house clean and
in order for my coming. Have the floor and all around the house swept carefully. Have
the ashes taken out. Wash your body and your hair with yucca suds the night before
I arrive, and bid your niece to wash herself also with yucca. I shall go off, now,
and tell the other divine ones about you.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">473.</span> As soon as he came home, Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani told his niece what things he wanted (except the baskets and the sacred buckskins);
but he did not tell her for what purpose he required them, and he asked her to steal
them from their neighbors. This she did, a few things at a time, and during many visits.
It took her three days to steal them all. On the evening of the third day, after they
had washed themselves with the yucca suds, he told her about the baskets and the sacred
buckskins which he needed. She went to the neighboring lodge and stole these articles,
wrapping the baskets up in the buckskins. When she returned with her booty, he wrapped
all the stolen goods up in the skins, put them away in the edge of the lodge, and
lay down to rest. He was a good sleeper, and usually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>slept all night; but on this occasion he woke about midnight, and could not go to
sleep again.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">474.</span> At dawn he heard, faintly, the distant &#x201c;Wu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hu&#x2bb;hú&#x201d; of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i. At once he woke his grandmother, saying: &#x201c;I hear a voice. The <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni (holy ones, divine ones) are coming.&#x201d; &#x201c;You fool,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Shut your mouth
and go to sleep. They would never come to visit such poor people as we are,&#x201d; and she
fell asleep again. In a little while he heard the voice a second time, louder and
nearer, and again he shook his grandmother and told her he heard the voices of the
gods; but she still would not believe him, and slept again. The third time that he
awoke her, when he heard the voices still more plainly, she remained awake, beginning
to believe him. The fourth time the call sounded loud and clear, as if cried by one
standing at the door. &#x201c;Hear,&#x201d; he said to his grandmother. &#x201c;Is that not truly the voice
of a divine one?&#x201d; At last she believed him, and said in wonder: &#x201c;Why should the <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni come to visit us?&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">475.</span> <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an were at the door, standing on the rainbow on which they had travelled. The former
made signs to the man, over the curtain which hung in the doorway, bidding him pull
the curtain aside and come out. &#x201c;Grandmother,&#x201d; said the Navaho, &#x201c;<i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i calls me to him.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is well,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Do as he bids you.&#x201d; As he went out,
bearing his bundle of sacrificial objects, he said: &#x201c;I go with the divine ones, but
I shall come back again to see you.&#x201d; The niece had a pet turkey<a href="#not203" class="noteref">203</a> that roosted on a tree near the lodge, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i made signs to the Navaho to take the turkey along. The Navaho said: &#x201c;My niece, the
gods bid me take your turkey, and I would gladly do it, for I am going among strange
people, where I shall be lonely. I love the bird; he would be company to me and remind
me of my home. Yet I shall not take him against your will.&#x201d; &#x201c;Then you may have my
turkey pet,&#x201d; replied the niece. The old woman said to the god: &#x201c;I shall be glad to
have my grandchild back again. Will you let him return to us?&#x201d; <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i only nodded his head. The gods turned the rainbow around sunwise, so that its head,<a href="#not204" class="noteref">204</a> which formerly pointed to the door of the lodge, now pointed in a new direction.
<i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i got on the bow first. He made the Navaho get on behind him. <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an got on behind the man. &#x201c;Shut your eyes,&#x201d; commanded <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, and the Navaho did as he was bidden.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">476.</span> In a moment <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i cried again: &#x201c;Open your eyes.&#x201d; The Navaho obeyed and found himself far away from
his home at Tsé&#x2bb;<i>t</i>a<i>d</i>i, where the <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni dwelt. They led him into a house in the rock which was full of divine people.
It was beautiful inside&#x2014;the walls were covered with rock crystal, which gave forth
a brilliant light. <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i ordered food brought for his visitor. The latter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>was handed a small earthen cup only so big (a circle made by the thumb and index finger
joined at the tips) filled with mush. &#x201c;What a poor meal to offer a stranger!&#x201d; thought
the Navaho, supposing he would finish it in one mouthful. But he ate, and ate, and
ate, and ate, from the cup and could not empty it. When he had eaten till he was satisfied
the little cup was as full as in the beginning.<a href="#not205" class="noteref">205</a> He handed the cup, when he was done, back to <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, who, with one sweep of his finger, emptied it, and it remained empty. The little
cup was then filled with water and given to the guest to drink. He drank till his
thirst was satisfied; but the cup was as full when he was done as it was when he began.
He handed it again to <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, who put it to his own lips and emptied it at a single swallow.
</p>
<p id="par477"><span class="parNum">477.</span> The gods opened the bundle of the Navaho and examined the contents to see if he had
brought all they required, and they found he had done so. In the mean time he filled
his pipe and lighted it. While he was smoking, the gods Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni, and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éol<i>t</i>oi<a href="#not206" class="noteref">206</a> arrived from <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;&#x2032;tli and entered the house. Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni said to the visitor: &#x201c;I hear that you
were found crawling into a hole which you had made in a log by burning. Why were you
doing this?&#x201d; In reply the Navaho told his whole story, as he had told it to <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, and ended by saying: &#x201c;I wished to go to <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;&#x2032;tli, where the rivers meet, or wherever else the waters would bear me. While
I was trying to carry out this plan, my grandfather, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, found me and bade me not to go. For this reason only I gave my plan up and went
home.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you still wish to go to <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;&#x2032;tli?&#x201d; said Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the Navaho, &#x201c;I wish to go to <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;y&#x115;&#x2032;tli or as far down the San Juan as I can get.&#x201d; &#x201c;Then you shall go,&#x201d; said the
god.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">478.</span> Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni went forth from the house and the other gods followed him. They went
to a grove of spruce, and there picked out a tree of unusual size. They tied rainbow
ropes to it, so that it might not fall with too great force and break in falling.
Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni and <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni cut it near the root with their great stone knives, and it fell to the north.
Crooked Lightning struck the fallen tree and went through it from butt to tip. Straight
Lightning struck it and went through it from tip to butt. Thus the hole was bored
in the log, and this was done before the branches were cut away. The hole that Crooked
Lightning bored was too crooked. Straight Lightning made it straight, but still it
was too small. Black Wind was sent into the hole, and he made it larger, but not large
enough. Blue Wind, Yellow Wind, and White Wind entered the hole, each in turn, and
each, as he went through, made it a little larger. It was not until White Wind had
done his work that the hole was big <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>enough to contain the body of a man. <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i supplied a bowl of food, a vessel of water, and a white cloud for bedding. They
wrapped the Navaho up in the cloud and put him into the log. They plugged the ends
with clouds,&#x2014;a black cloud in the butt and a blue cloud in the tip,&#x2014;and charged him
not to touch either of these cloudy plugs. When they got him into the log some one
said: &#x201c;How will he get light? How will he know when it is night and when it is day?&#x201d;
They bored two holes in the log, one on each side of his head, and they put in each
hole, to make a window, a piece of rock crystal, which they pushed in so tightly that
water could not leak in around it.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">479.</span> While some of the gods were preparing the log, others were getting the pet turkey
ready for his journey, but they did this unknown to the Navaho. They put about his
body black cloud, he-rain, black mist, and she-rain. They put under his wings white
corn, yellow corn, blue corn, corn of mixed colors, squash seed, watermelon seed,
muskmelon seed, gourd seed, and beans of all colors. These were the six gods who prepared
the turkey: four of the Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i<a href="#not207" class="noteref">207</a> from a place called <i>D</i>epé<i>h</i>a<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>i<i>l</i>, one <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an from Tse&#x2bb;gíhi,<a href="#not165" class="noteref">165</a> and the <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an from Tsé&#x2bb;<i>t</i>a<i>d</i>i,&#x2014;the one who found the Navaho entering his cottonwood log and took him home to the
house in the rocks.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">480.</span> The next thing they had to think about was how they should carry the heavy log to
the river with the man inside of it. They put under the log (first) a rope of crooked
lightning, (second) a rope of rainbow, (third) a rope of straight lightning, and (fourth)
another rope of rainbow. They attached a sunbeam to each end of the log. All the gods
except those who were engaged in preparing the turkey tried to move the log, but they
could not stir it; and they sent for the six who were at work on the turkey to come
to their aid. Two of the Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i were now stationed at each end, and two of the <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an in the middle. The others were stationed at other parts. The Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i put their wands under the log crosswise, thus, X. All lifted together, and the log
was carried along. Some of them said: &#x201c;If strength fail us and we let the log fall,
we shall not attempt to raise it again, and the Navaho will not make his journey.&#x201d;
As they went along some became tired and were about to let the log go, but the winds
came to help them&#x2014;Black Wind and Blue Wind in front, Yellow Wind and White Wind behind,
and soon the log was borne to the margin of the river. As they went along, <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li,<a href="#not98" class="noteref">98</a> the Water Sprinkler, made fun and played tricks, as he now does in the dances, to
show that he was pleased with what they were doing. While the gods were at work the
Navaho sang five songs, each for a different part of the work; the significant words
of the songs were these:&#x2014;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>First Song, &#x201c;A beautiful tree they fell for me.&#x201d;
</li>
<li>Second Song, &#x201c;A beautiful tree they prepare for me.&#x201d;
</li>
<li>Third Song, &#x201c;A beautiful tree they finish for me.&#x201d;
</li>
<li>Fourth Song, &#x201c;A beautiful tree they carry with me.&#x201d;
</li>
<li>Fifth Song, &#x201c;A beautiful tree they launch with me.&#x201d;<a href="#not283" class="noteref">283</a></li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p id="par481"><span class="parNum">481.</span> When they threw the log on the surface of the water it floated around in different
directions, but would not go down stream, so the gods consulted together to determine
what they should do. They covered the log first with black mist and then with black
cloud. Some of the gods standing on the banks punched the log with their plumed wands,
when it approached the shore or began to whirl round, and they kept this up till it
got into a straight course, with its head pointed down stream, and floated on. When
the gods were punching the log to get it into the current, the Navaho sang a song,
the principal words of which were:&#x2014;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">1. &#x201c;A beautiful tree, they push with me.&#x201d;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When the log was about to go down the stream, he sang:&#x2014;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">2. &#x201c;A beautiful tree is about to float along with me,&#x201d;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and when the log got into the current and went down, he sang:&#x2014;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">3. &#x201c;A beautiful tree floats along with me.&#x201d;<a href="#not284" class="noteref">284</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">482.</span> All went well till they approached a pueblo called K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i>, or Blue House,<a href="#not208" class="noteref">208</a> when two of the Kisáni, who were going to hunt eaglets, saw the log floating by,
though they could not see the gods that guided its course. Wood was scarce around
Blue House. When the men saw the log they said, &#x201c;There floats a big tree. It would
furnish us fuel for many days if we could get it. We must try to bring it to the shore.&#x201d;
The two men ran back to the pueblo and announced that a great log was coming down
the river. A number of people turned out to seize it. Most of them ran down the stream
to a shallow place where they could all wade in, to await the arrival of the log,
while a few went up along the bank to herald its approach. When it came to the shallow
place they tried to break off branches, but failed. They tied ropes to the branches,
and tried to pull it ashore; but the log, hurried on by the current, carried the crowd
with it. But the next time the log got to a shallow place the Kisáni got it stranded,
and sent back to the pueblo for axes, intending to cut off branches and make the log
light. When the gods saw the people coming with axes they said: &#x201c;Something must be
done.&#x201d; They sent down a great shower of rain, but the Kisáni held on to the log. They
sent hail, with hailstones as big as two fists; but still the Kisáni held on. They
sent lightning to the right&#x2014;the people to the left held on. They sent lightning to
the left&#x2014;the people to the right held on. They sent lightning in all directions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>four times, when, at last, the Kisáni let go and the log floated on. Now the gods
laid upon the log a cloud so thick that no one could see through it; they put a rainbow
lengthwise and a rainbow crosswise over it, and they caused the zigzag lightning to
flash all around it. When the Kisáni saw all these things they began to fear. &#x201c;The
gods must guard this log,&#x201d; they said. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the chief. &#x201c;Go to your homes, and
let the log pass on. It must be holy.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">483.</span> The log floated steadily with the stream till it came to a place where a ridge of
rocks, standing nearly straight up, disturbs the current, and here the log became
entangled in the rocks. But two of the Fringe-mouths<a href="#not209" class="noteref">209</a> of the river raised it from the rocks and set it floating again. They turned the
log around, one standing at each end, until they got it lying lengthwise with the
current, and then they let it float away.
</p>
<p id="par484"><span class="parNum">484.</span> Thence it floated safely to <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>h</i>o<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i>, where the gods on the bank observed it stopping and slowly sinking, until only a
few leaves on the ends of the branches could be seen. It was the sacred people under
the water who had pulled the log down this time. These were Tiéholtsodi, Tie<i>l</i>í<i>n</i>,<a href="#not210" class="noteref">210</a> Frog, Fish, Beaver, Otter, and others. They took the Navaho out of the log and bore
him down to their home under the water. The gods on the bank held a council to consider
why the tree stuck. They shook it and tried to get it loose, but they could not move
it. Then they called on <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li, Water Sprinkler, to help them. He had two magic water jars, <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;sa<i>d</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>y&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>, the black jar, which he carried in his right hand, and <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;sa<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>, the blue jar, which he carried in his left hand; with these he struck the water
to the right and to the left, crying as he did so his call of &#x201c;Tu&#x2bb;wu&#x2bb;wu&#x2bb;wú!&#x201d; The water
opened before him and allowed him to descend. He went around the tree, and when he
came to the butt he found that the plug had been withdrawn and that the Navaho was
no longer there. He called up to his friends on the bank and told them what he had
found. They spread a short rainbow<a href="#not211" class="noteref">211</a> for him to travel on, and he went to the house of the divine ones under the water.
This house consisted of four chambers, one under another, like the stories of a pueblo
dwelling. The first chamber, that on top, was black; the second was blue; the third
yellow; the fourth white.<a href="#not18" class="noteref">18</a> Two of the Tie<i>l</i>í<i>n</i>, or water pets with blue horns, stood at the door facing one another, and roared
as <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li passed. He descended from one story to another, but found no one till he
came to the last chamber, and here he saw Tiéholtsodi, the water monster; T<i>s</i>al, Frog (a big rough frog); T<i>s</i>a, Beaver, <i>T</i>ábas<i>t</i>i<i>n</i>, Otter, Tlo&#x2bb;ayu&#x12d;nl&#x12d;&#x2032;tigi (a great fish), and the captive Navaho. &#x201c;I seek my grandchild.
Give him to me,&#x201d; said <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li. &#x201c;Shut your mouth and begone,&#x201d; said Tiéholtsodi. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>&#x201c;Such as you cannot come here giving orders. I fear you not, Water Sprinkler; you
shall not have your grandchild.&#x201d; Then <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li went out again and told his friends what had happened to him, and what had
been said in the house of Tiéholtsodi under the water.
</p>
<p id="par485"><span class="parNum">485.</span> The gods held another council. &#x201c;Who shall go down and rescue our grandchild?&#x201d; was
the question they asked one another. While they were talking <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni<a href="#not212" class="noteref">212</a> (Black God), who owns all fire, sat apart and took no part in the council. He had
built a fire, while the others waited, and sat with his back to it, as was his custom.
&#x201c;Go tell your grandfather there what has occurred,&#x201d; said the others to <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li. The latter went over to where <span class="corr" id="xd29e9823" title="Source: Hastséz&#x12d;ni"><i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni</span> sat. &#x201c;Why are they gathered together yonder and of what do they talk so angrily?&#x201d;
said the Black God. In answer, <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li told of his adventures under the water and what Tiéholtsodi had said to him.
<i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni was angry when he heard all this. &#x201c;I fear not the sacred people beneath the water,&#x201d;
he said. &#x201c;I shall have my grandchild.&#x201d; He hastened to the river, taking <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li with him, for <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li had the power to open the water, and these two descended into the river.
When they reached the room where Tiéholtsodi sat, the Black God said, &#x201c;We come together
for our grandchild.&#x201d; &#x201c;Run out there, both of you. Such as you may not enter here,&#x201d;
said Tiéholtsodi. &#x201c;I go not without my grandson. Give him to me, and I shall go,&#x201d;
said the other. &#x201c;Run out,&#x201d; repeated Tiéholtsodi, &#x201c;I shall not release your grandchild.&#x201d;
&#x201c;I shall take my grandchild. I fear you not.&#x201d; &#x201c;I shall not restore him to you. I heed
not your words.&#x201d; &#x201c;I never recall what I have once spoken. I have come for my grandchild,
and I shall not leave without him.&#x201d; &#x201c;I said you should not go with him, and I mean
what I say. I am mighty.&#x201d; Thus they spoke defiantly to one another for some time.
At length <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni said: &#x201c;I shall beg no longer for my grandchild. You say you are mighty. We shall
see which is the more powerful, you or I,&#x201d; and Tiéholtsodi answered: &#x201c;Neither shall
I ask your permission to keep him. I should like to see how you will take him from
me.&#x201d; When <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni heard this he took from his belt his fire-stick and fire-drill.<a href="#not213" class="noteref">213</a> He laid the stick on the ground, steadied it with both feet, and whirled the drill
around, pausing four times. The first time he whirled the drill there was a little
smoke; the second time there was a great smoke; the third time there was flame; the
fourth time the surrounding waters all took fire. Then Tiéholtsodi cried: &#x201c;Take your
grandchild, but put out the flames.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni, &#x201c;you told me you were mighty. Why do you implore me now? Why do you not put out
the fire yourself? Do you mean what you say this time? Do you really want <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>the fire quenched?&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh! yes,&#x201d; cried Tiéholtsodi. &#x201c;Take your grandchild, but put out
the flames. I mean what I say.&#x201d; At a sign from Black God, Water Sprinkler took the
stoppers out of his jars and scattered water all around him four times, crying his
usual &#x201c;Tu&#x2bb;wu&#x2bb;wu&#x2bb;wú&#x201d; as he did so, and the flames died out. The water in <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li&#x2019;s jars consisted of all kinds of water&#x2014;he-rain, she-rain, hail, snow, lake-water,
spring-water, and water taken from the four quarters of the world. This is why it
was so potent.<a href="#not67" class="noteref">67</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">486.</span> When the fire was extinguished the three marched out in single file&#x2014;<i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li in front, to divide the water, the Navaho in the middle, and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni in the rear. Before they had quite reached the dry land they heard a flopping
sound behind them, and, looking around, they saw T<i>s</i>a<i>l</i>, the Frog. &#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; said he. &#x201c;I have something to tell you. We can give disease to
those who enter our dwelling, and there are cigarettes, sacred to us, by means of
which our spell may be taken away. The cigarette of Tiéholtsodi should be painted
black; that of Tie<i>l</i>í<i>n</i>, blue; those of the Beaver and the Otter, yellow; that of the great fish, and that
sacred to me, white.&#x201d; Therefore, in these days, when a Navaho is nearly drowned in
the water, and has spewed the water all out, such cigarettes<a href="#not12" class="noteref">12</a> are made to take the water sickness out of him.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">487.</span> The gods took Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani back to his log. <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li opened a passage for them through the river, and took the water out of the
hollow in the log. The Navaho crawled into the hollow. The gods plugged the butt again,
and set the log floating. It floated on and on until it came to a fall in the San
Juan River, and here it stuck again. The gods had hard labor trying to get it loose.
They tugged and worked, but could not move it. At length the Dsaha<i>d</i>old<i>z</i>á, the Fringe-mouths of the water, came to help. They put the zigzag lightning which
was on their bodies<a href="#not209" class="noteref">209</a> under the butt of the log,&#x2014;as if the lightning were a rope,&#x2014;and soon they got the
log loose and sent it floating down the river.
</p>
<p id="par488"><span class="parNum">488.</span> At the end of the San Juan River, surrounded by mountains, there is a whirling lake
or large whirlpool called <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nihili<i>n</i>, or End of the Water. When the log entered here it whirled around the lake four times.
The first time it went around it floated near the shore, but it gradually approached
the centre as it went round again and again. From the centre it pointed itself toward
the east and got near the shore; but it retreated again to the centre, pointed itself
to the south, and at last stranded on the south shore of the lake. When it came to
land four gods stood around it thus: <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an on the east, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i on the south, one Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i on the west, and one on the north. They pried out one of the stoppers with their
wands, and the Navaho came out on the land. They took <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>out what remained of the food they had given him, a bow of cedar with the leaves on,
and two reed arrows that they had placed in the log before they launched it. This
done, they plugged the log again with a black cloud.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">489.</span> Then the gods spoke to the Navaho and said: &#x201c;We have taken you where you wished to
go. We have brought you to the end of the river. We have done for you all that in
the beginning you asked us to do, and now we shall give you a new name. Henceforth
you shall be called Á<i>h</i>o<i>d</i>&#x12d;se<i>l</i>i, He Who Floats. Go sit yonder&#x201d; (pointing out a place), &#x201c;and turn your back to us.&#x201d;
He went and sat as he was told, and soon they called to him and bade him go to a hill
west of the lake. When he ascended it he looked around and saw the log moving back
in the direction whence, he thought, he had come. He looked all around, but could
see no one. The gods had disappeared, and he was all alone. He sat down to think.
He felt sad and lonely. He was sorry he had come; yet, he thought, &#x201c;This is my own
deed; I insisted on coming here, and had I stayed at home I might have been killed.&#x201d;
Still the more he thought the sadder he felt, and he began to weep.

</div><p>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">490.</span> The mountains all around the lake were very precipitous, except on the west side.
Here they were more sloping, and he began to think of crossing, when he heard faintly
in the distance the gobbling of a turkey. He paused and listened, and soon heard the
gobbling again, more distinctly and apparently nearer. In a short time he heard the
sound for the third time, but louder and clearer than before. The fourth time that
the gobbling was heard it seemed very loud and distinct; and a moment later he beheld,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>running toward him, his pet turkey, whom he had thought he would never see again.
The turkey, which had followed him all the way down the San Juan River, now approached
its master from the east, as if it were coming to him at once; but when it got within
arm&#x2019;s length of the man it retreated and went round him sunwise, approaching and retreating
again at the south, the west, and the north. When it got to the east again it ran
up to its master and allowed itself to be embraced. (<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> shows the way it approached its master.) &#x201c;A<i>h</i>aláni, <i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>í<i>n</i> (Welcome, my pet),&#x201d; said Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani, &#x201c;I am sorry for you that you have followed me, I pity you; but now that you are
here, I thank you for coming.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">491.</span> The man now began to think again of crossing the mountain in the west, but suddenly
night came on. He had not noticed the light fading until it was too dark to begin
the journey, and he felt obliged to seek a resting-place for the night. They went
to a gulch near at hand where there were a few small cedar-trees. They spread out,
for a bed, the dead leaves and the soft débris which they found under the trees and
lay down, side by side, to sleep. The Navaho spread his bark blanket over himself,
and the turkey spread one of its wings over its master, and he slept well that night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">492.</span> Next morning they rose early and went out to hunt wood-rats. They went down a small
winding valley till they came to a beautiful flat, through which ran a stream of water.
&#x201c;This would be a good place for a farm if I had but the seeds to plant,&#x201d; said the
Navaho aloud. When he had spoken he observed that his turkey began to act in a very
peculiar manner. It ran to the western border of the flat, circled round to the north,
and then ran directly from north to south, where it rejoined its master, who had in
the mean time walked around the edge of the flat from east to west. This (<a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>) shows how they went. When they met they walked together four times around the flat,
gradually approaching the centre as they walked. Here, in the centre, the man sat
down and the turkey gambolled around him. &#x201c;My pet,&#x201d; said the Navaho, &#x201c;what a beautiful
farm I could make here if I only had the seeds.&#x201d; The turkey gobbled in reply and spread
out its wings.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">493.</span> Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani had supposed that when the gods were preparing the log for him they had done something
to the turkey, but what they had done he knew not. Now that his pet was acting so
strangely, it occurred to him that perhaps it could aid him. &#x201c;My pet,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;can
you do anything to help me make a farm here?&#x201d; The turkey ran a little way to the east
and shook its wings, from which four grains of white corn dropped out; then it ran
to the south and shook from its wings four grains of blue corn; at the west it shook
out four grains of yellow corn, and at the north four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>grains of variegated corn. Then it ran up to its master from the east and shook its
wings four times, each time shaking out four seeds. The first time it dropped pumpkin
seeds; the second time, watermelon seeds; the third time, muskmelon seeds; the fourth
time, beans. &#x201c;E&#x2bb;yéhe, <i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>í<i>n</i> (Thanks, my pet). I thought you had something for me,&#x201d; said Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani.

</p>
<p><span class="parNum">494.</span> He went away from the flat, roasted wood-rats for a meal, and when he had eaten he
made two planting sticks, one of greasewood and one of ts&#x12d;ntl&#x12d;&#x2032;zi<a href="#not214" class="noteref">214</a> (<i lang="la">Fendleria rupicola</i>). He returned to the flat and began to make his farm. He dug four holes in the east
with the stick of ts&#x12d;ntl&#x12d;&#x2032;zi, and dropped into each hole a grain of white corn. He
dug four holes in the south with his greasewood stick, and placed in each hole one
grain of blue corn. He dug four holes in the west with the ts&#x12d;ntl&#x12d;&#x2032;zi stick, and planted
in each one grain of yellow corn. He made four holes in the north with the greasewood,
and put in each one grain of variegated corn. With the implement of ts&#x12d;ntl&#x12d;&#x2032;zi he
planted the pumpkin seed between the white corn and the blue corn. With the implement
of greasewood he planted watermelon seed between the blue corn and the yellow corn.
With the stick of ts&#x12d;ntl&#x12d;&#x2032;zi he planted muskmelon seeds between the yellow corn and
the variegated corn. With the stick of greasewood he planted beans between the variegated
corn and the white corn.<a href="#not215" class="noteref">215</a> He looked all around to see if he had done everything properly, and he went to the
west of his farm among the foothills and camped there.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">495.</span> He felt uneasy during the night, fearing that there might be some one else to claim
the land, and he determined to examine the surrounding country to see if he had any
neighbors. Next day he walked in a circle, sunwise, around the valley, and this he
did for four consecutive days, taking a wider circle each day; but he met no people
and saw no signs of human life, and he said: &#x201c;It is a good place for a farm. No one
claims the land before me.&#x201d; Each morning, before he went on his journey, he visited
his farm. On the fourth morning he saw that the corn had grown half a finger-length
above the ground.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">496.</span> On the fourth night, after his long day&#x2019;s walk around the valley, when darkness fell,
he sat by his fire facing the east, and was surprised to see a faint gleam half way
up the side of the mountains in the east. &#x201c;Strange,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I have travelled all
over that ground and have seen neither man nor house nor track nor the remains of
fire.&#x201d; Then he spoke to the turkey, saying: &#x201c;Stay at home to-morrow, my pet; I must
go and find out who builds that fire.&#x201d;
</p>
<p id="par497"><span class="parNum">497.</span> Next day, leaving his turkey at home, he went off to search the mountain-side, where
he had seen the gleam; but he searched well and saw no signs of human life. When he
came home he told all his adventures to his turkey and said: &#x201c;It must have been a
great glow-worm that I beheld.&#x201d; He got home pretty early in the day and went out to
trap wood-rats, accompanied by his turkey. In the evening when he returned to his
camp, he looked again, after dark, toward the eastern mountain, and saw the gleam
as he had seen it the night before. He set a forked stick in the ground, got down
on his hands and knees, and looked at the fire through the fork. (See <a href="#par382">par. 382</a>.)
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">498.</span> On the following morning he placed himself in the same position he was in the night
before,&#x2014;putting his hands and knees in the tracks then made,&#x2014;and looked again over
the forked stick. He found his sight directed to a spot which he had already explored
well. Notwithstanding this he went there again, leaving his turkey behind, and searched
wider and farther and with greater care than on previous occasions; but he still saw
no traces of human life. When he returned to camp he told his turkey all that had
happened to him. That night he saw the light again, and once more he sighted over
the forked stick with care.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">499.</span> When morning came, he found that he had marked the same spot he had marked before;
and though he had little hope he set out for the third time to find who made the distant
fire. He returned after a time, only to tell his disappointment to his turkey. As
usual he spent the rest of the day, accompanied by the turkey, setting traps for wood-rats
and other small animals. After dark, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>when he saw the distant flame again, he set a second forked stick in the ground and
laid between the two forks a long, straight stick, which he aimed at the fire as he
would aim an arrow. When this was done he went to sleep.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">500.</span> Next morning he noted with great care the particular spot to which the straight stick
pointed, and set out to find the fire. Before he left he said to his turkey: &#x201c;I go
once more to seek the distant fire; but it is the last time I shall seek it. If I
find it not to-day, I shall never try again. Stay here till I return.&#x201d; While he spoke
the turkey turned its back on him, and showed its master that it was angry. It acted
like a pouting child. He went to the place on the eastern mountain to which the stick
pointed, and here he found, what he had not observed before, a shelf in the rocks,
which seemed to run back some distance. He climbed to the shelf and discovered there
two nice huts. He thought that wealthy people must dwell in them. He felt ashamed
of his ragged bark blanket, of his garment of wood-rat skins, of his worn grass sandals;
of his poor bow and arrows; so he took these off, laid them in the fork of a juniper-tree,
and, retaining only his breech-cloth of wood-rat skins, his belt, tobacco pouch, and
pipe, he approached one of the houses.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">501.</span> He pushed aside the curtain and saw, sitting inside, a young woman making a fine
buckskin shirt which she was garnishing beautifully with fringes and shells. Ashamed
of his appearance, he hung his head and advanced, looking at her under his eyebrows.
&#x201c;Where are the men?&#x201d; he said, and he sat on the ground. The young woman replied: &#x201c;My
father and mother are in the other hut.&#x201d; Just as the Navaho had made up his mind to
go to the other house the father entered. Doubtless the Navaho had been observed while
disrobing, for the old man, as he came in, brought the poor rags with him. &#x201c;Why do
you not take in my son-in-law&#x2019;s goods?&#x201d; said the old man to his daughter, as he laid
the ragged bundle in a conspicuous place on top of a pile of fine fabrics. Poor Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani hung his head again in shame and blushed, while the woman looked sideways and
smiled. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you spread a skin for my son-in-law to sit on?&#x201d; said the old man
to his daughter. She only smiled and looked sideways again. The old man took a finely
dressed Rocky Mountain sheep-skin and a deer-skin,&#x2014;skins finer than the Navaho had
ever seen before,&#x2014;spread them on the ground beside the woman, and said to the stranger:
&#x201c;Why do you not sit on the skins?&#x201d; Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani made a motion as if to rise and take the offered seat, but he sank back again
in shame. Invited a second time, he arose and sat down beside the young woman on the
skins.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">502.</span> The old man placed another skin beside the Navaho, sat on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>it, tapped the visitor on the knee to attract his attention, and said: &#x201c;I long for
a smoke. Fill your pipe<a href="#not216" class="noteref">216</a> with tobacco and let me smoke it.&#x201d; The Navaho answered: &#x201c;I am poor. I have nothing.&#x201d;
Four times this request was made and this reply given. On the fourth occasion the
Navaho added: &#x201c;I belong to the Ninoká<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb; (the People up on the Earth),<a href="#not217" class="noteref">217</a> and I have nothing.&#x201d; &#x201c;I thought the Ninoká<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb; had plenty of tobacco,&#x201d; said the old man. The young man now drew from his pouch,
which was adorned with pictures of the sun and moon, a mixture of native wild tobacco
with four other plants.<a href="#not218" class="noteref">218</a> His pipe was made of clay, collected from a place where a wood-rat had been tearing
the ground. He filled the pipe with the mixture, lighted it with the sun,<a href="#not219" class="noteref">219</a> sucked it four times till it was well kindled, and handed it to the old man to smoke.
When the latter had finished the pipe and laid it down he began to perspire violently
and soon fell into a swoon. The young woman thought her father was dead or dying,
and ran to the other lodge to tell her mother. The mother gave the young woman a quantity
of goods and said: &#x201c;Give these to my son-in-law and tell him they shall all be his
if he restores your father to life.&#x201d; When the daughter returned to the lodge where
her father lay, she said to the Navaho: &#x201c;Here are goods for you. Treat my father.
You must surely know what will cure him.&#x201d; They laid the old man out on his side, in
the middle of the floor, with his head to the north and his face to the east. The
Navaho had in his pouch a medicine called ké&#x2bb;tlo, or atsósi ké&#x2bb;tlo,<a href="#not220" class="noteref">220</a> consisting of many different ingredients. Where he got the ingredients we know not;
but the medicine men now collect them around the headwaters of the San Juan. He put
some of this medicine into a pipe, lighted it with the sunbeams, puffed the smoke
to the earth, to the sky, to the earth, and to the sky again; puffed it at the patient
from the east, the south, the west, and the north. When this fumigation was done,
the patient began to show signs of life,&#x2014;his eyelids twitched, his limbs jerked, his
body shook. Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani directed the young woman to put some of the medicine, with water, to soak in an
earthen bowl,&#x2014;no other kind of bowl is now used in making this infusion,&#x2014;and when
it was soaked enough he rubbed it on the body of the patient.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">503.</span> &#x201c;<i>S</i>a<i>d</i>áni, <i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>t</i>á (My son-in-law, my nephew),&#x201d; said the old man, when he came to his senses once more,
&#x201c;fill the pipe for me again. I like your tobacco.&#x201d; The Navaho refused and the old
man begged again. Four times did the old man beg and thrice the young man refused
him; but when the fourth request was made the young man filled the pipe, lit it as
before, and handed it to the old man. The latter smoked, knocked out the ashes, laid
down the pipe, began to perspire, and fell again into a deathly swoon. As on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>the previous occasion, the women were alarmed and offered the Navaho a large fee,
in goods, if he would restore the smoker to life. The medicine being administered
and the ceremonies being repeated, the old man became again conscious.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">504.</span> As soon as he recovered he said: &#x201c;My son-in-law, give me another smoke. I have travelled
far and smoked much tobacco; but such fine tobacco as yours I never smoked before.&#x201d;
As on the other occasions, the old man had to beg four times before his request was
granted. A third time the pipe was filled; the old man smoked and swooned; the women
gave presents to the Navaho; the atsósi ké&#x2bb;tlo was administered, and the smoker came
to life again.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">505.</span> But as soon as he regained his senses he pleaded for another smoke. &#x201c;The smoke is
bad for you,&#x201d; said the Navaho. &#x201c;It does you harm. Why do you like my tobacco so well?&#x201d;
&#x201c;Ah! it makes me feel good to the ends of my toes. It smells well and tastes well.&#x201d;
&#x201c;Since you like it so well,&#x201d; said the young man, &#x201c;I shall give you one more pipeful.&#x201d;
This time the old man smoked vigorously; he drew the smoke well into his chest and
kept it there a long time before blowing it out. Everything happened now as before,
but in addition to the medicine used previously, the Navaho scattered the fragrant
yá<i>d</i>i<i>d</i>&#x12d;ni<i>l</i><a href="#not221" class="noteref">221</a> on the hot coals and let the patient breathe its fumes. The Navaho had now four large
bundles of fine goods as pay for his services. When the old man recovered for the
fourth time he praised loudly the tobacco of the Navaho. He said he had never felt
so happy as when smoking it. He asked the Navaho: &#x201c;How would you like to try my tobacco?&#x201d;
and he went to the other lodge to fetch his tobacco pouch. While he was gone the Wind
People whispered into the ear of the Navaho: &#x201c;His tobacco will kill you surely. It
is not like your tobacco. Those who smoke it never wake again!&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">506.</span> Presently the old man returned with a pouch that had pictures of the sun and moon
on it, and with a large pipe&#x2014;much larger than that of the Navaho&#x2014;decorated with figures
of deer, antelope, elk, and Rocky Mountain sheep.<a href="#not222" class="noteref">222</a> The old man filled his pipe, lighted it, puffed the smoke to earth and sky, each
twice, alternately, and handed the pipe to the Navaho. The young man said: &#x201c;I allow
no one to fill the pipe for me but myself. My customs differ from yours. You ask a
stranger for a smoke. I ask no man for a smoke. I pick my own tobacco. Other people&#x2019;s
tobacco makes me ill; that is why I do not use it.&#x201d; Thus he spoke, yet the stuff he
had given the old man to smoke was not the same that he used himself. The latter consisted
of four kinds of tobacco: glóna&#x323;<i>t</i>o, or weasel tobacco, <i>d</i>epéna&#x323;<i>t</i>o, or sheep tobacco, ds&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>na&#x323;<i>t</i>o, or mountain tobacco, and kósna&#x323;<i>t</i>o, or cloud tobacco.<a href="#not223" class="noteref">223</a> He had different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>compartments in his pouch for his different mixtures. The old man invited him four
times to smoke; but four times the Navaho refused, and said at last: &#x201c;I have my pipe
already filled with my own tobacco. I shall smoke it. My tobacco injures no one unless
he is ill.&#x201d; He proceeded to smoke the pure tobacco. When he had done smoking, he said:
&#x201c;See. It does me no harm. Try another pipeful.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">507.</span> He now filled his pipe with the mixture of four kinds of real tobacco and handed
it to the old man to smoke. When the latter had finished he said: &#x201c;Your tobacco does
not taste as it did before, and I do not now feel the same effect after smoking it
as I did at first. Now it cools me; formerly it made me perspire. Why did I fall down
when I smoked it before? Tell me, have I some disease?&#x201d; The Navaho answered: &#x201c;Yes.
It is ya<i>s</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;nt<i>s</i>ogi, something bad inside of you, that makes the tobacco affect you so. There are
four diseases that may cause this: they are the yellow disease, the cooked-blood disease,
the water-slime disease, and the worm disease. One or more of these diseases you surely
have.&#x201d;<a href="#not224" class="noteref">224</a> The old man closed his eyes and nodded his head to show that he believed what was
told him. Of course the Navaho did not believe what he himself had said; he only told
this to the old man to conceal the fact that he had filled the pipe with poisoned
tobacco.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">508.</span> While all these things were happening the Navaho had paid no heed to how the day
was passing; but now he became suddenly aware that it was late in the afternoon and
that the sun was about to set. &#x201c;I must hasten away. It is late,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No, my
son-in-law; do not leave us,&#x201d; pleaded the old man. &#x201c;Sleep here to-night.&#x201d; He ordered
his daughter to make a bed for the stranger. She spread on the floor fine robes of
otter-skin and beaver-skin, beautifully ornamented. He laid down on the rugs and slept
there that night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">509.</span> Next morning the young woman rose early and went out. Soon after her departure the
old man entered the lodge and said to his guest: &#x201c;I and my daughter were so busy yesterday
with all that you did to me, and all the cures you wrought on me, that we had no time
to cook food and eat; neither had you. She has gone now to prepare food. Stay and
eat with us.&#x201d; Presently the young woman returned, bringing a dish of stewed venison
and a basket filled with mush made of wild seeds. The basket was such a one as the
Navahoes now use in their rites.<a href="#not5" class="noteref">5</a> On the a<i>t</i>áatlo (the part where the coil terminates, the point of finish), the old man had,
with the knowledge of his daughter, placed poison. She presented the basket to the
stranger, with the point of finish toward him, as her father had directed her to do,
saying: &#x201c;When a stranger visits us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>we always expect him to eat from the part of the basket where it is finished.&#x201d; As
he took the basket the Wind People<a href="#not75" class="noteref">75</a> whispered to him: &#x201c;Eat not from that part of the basket; death is there, but there
is no death in the venison.&#x201d; The young man turned the basket around and began to eat
from the side opposite to that which was presented to him, saying: &#x201c;It is my custom
to eat from the edge opposite to the point of finish.&#x201d; He did not eat all the mush.
He tried the venison stew; but as it was made of dried meat he did not like it and
ate very little of it. When he had done she took the dishes back to the other lodge.
&#x201c;From which side of the basket did my son-in-law eat?&#x201d; asked the old man. &#x201c;From the
wrong side. He told me it was his custom never to eat from the side where the basket
was finished,&#x201d; said the young woman. Her father was surprised. When a visitor came
to him he always tried the poisoned tobacco first; if that failed he next tried the
poisoned basket. &#x201c;My husband says he wants to go home now,&#x201d; said the young woman.
&#x201c;Tell him it is not the custom for a man to go home the morning after his marriage.
He should always remain four days at least,&#x201d; said the old man. She brought this message
back to the Navaho. He remained that day and slept in the lodge at night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">510.</span> Next morning the young woman rose early again and went to the other lodge. Soon after
she was gone the old man entered and said to Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani: &#x201c;You would do well not to leave till you have eaten. My daughter is preparing
food for you.&#x201d; In a little while, after he left, the young woman entered, bringing,
as before, a dish of stewed venison and a basketful of mush, which she handed to the
Navaho without making any remark. But Wind whispered: &#x201c;There is poison all around
the edge of the basket this time; there is none in the venison.&#x201d; The Navaho ate some
of the stew, and when he took the basket of mush he ate only from the middle, saying:
&#x201c;When I eat just as the sun is about to come up, it is my custom to eat only from
the middle of the basket.&#x201d; The sun was about to rise as he spoke. When she went back
to the other lodge with the remains of the meal, her father asked: &#x201c;How did he eat
this morning?&#x201d; She replied: &#x201c;He ate the stew; but the mush he ate only from the middle
of the basket.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ah&#x103;h&#x103;há!&#x201d; said the old man, &#x201c;it never took me so long, before.&#x201d; The
Navaho remained in the lodge all that day and all night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">511.</span> The next (third) morning things happened as before: the woman rose early, and while
she was gone the old man came into the lodge, saying: &#x201c;The women are cooking food
for you. Don&#x2019;t go out till you have eaten.&#x201d; The reason they gave their visitor only
one meal a day was that he might be so ravenous with hunger when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>it came that he would not notice the poison and would eat plenty of it. When the food
was brought in, the Wind People whispered to the Navaho: &#x201c;Poison is mixed all through
the mush, take none of it.&#x201d; He ate heartily of the stew, and when he was done he said
to the young woman: &#x201c;I may eat no mush to-day. The sun is already risen, and I have
sworn that the sun shall never see me eat mush.&#x201d; When she went back to the other lodge
her father asked: &#x201c;How did my son-in-law eat this morning?&#x201d; &#x201c;He ate only of the stew,&#x201d;
she said. &#x201c;He would not touch the mush.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ah&#x103;h&#x103;há,&#x201d; said the old man in a suspicious
tone; but he said no more. Again the Navaho stayed all day and all night.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">512.</span> On the fourth morning when the daughter went to prepare food and the old man entered
the lodge, he said: &#x201c;Go out somewhere to-day. Why do you not take a walk abroad every
day? Is it on your wife&#x2019;s account that you stay at home so much, my son-in-law?&#x201d; When
the young woman brought in the usual venison stew and basket of mush, Wind whispered:
&#x201c;All the food is poisoned this morning.&#x201d; When she handed the food to the young man
he said: &#x201c;I do not eat at all to-day. It is my custom to eat no food one day in every
four. This is the day that I must fast.&#x201d; When she took the untasted food back to the
other lodge, her father inquired: &#x201c;What did my son-in-law eat this morning?&#x201d; and she
answered: &#x201c;He ate nothing.&#x201d; The old man was lying when he spoke; he rose when she
answered him and carefully examined the food she had brought back. &#x201c;Truly, nothing
has been touched,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This must be a strange man who eats nothing. My daughter,
do you tell him anything he should not know?&#x201d; &#x201c;Truly, I tell him nothing,&#x201d; she replied.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">513.</span> When the young woman came back again from her father&#x2019;s lodge, the Navaho said to
her: &#x201c;I have a hut and a farm and a pet not far from here; I must go home to-day and
see them.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is well,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You may go.&#x201d; He began to dress for the journey
by putting on his old sandals. She brought him a pair of fine new moccasins, beautifully
embroidered, and urged him to put them on; but he refused them, saying: &#x201c;I may put
them on some other time. I shall wear my old sandals to-day.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">514.</span> When Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani got back to his farm he found the tracks of his turkey all around, but the turkey
itself he could not see. It was evident from the tracks that it had visited the farm
and gone back to the hut again. The Navaho made four circuits around the hut&#x2014;each
circuit wider than the preceding&#x2014;to see whither the tracks led. On the fourth circuit
he found they led to the base of a mountain which stood north of the hut. &#x201c;I shall
find my pet somewhere around the mountain,&#x201d; thought the Navaho. The tracks had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>the appearance of being four days old, and from this he concluded that the turkey
had left the same day he had. It took him four days, travelling sunwise and going
spirally up the mountain, to reach the summit, where he found many turkey tracks,
but still no turkey. He fancied his pet might have descended the mountain again, so
he went below and examined the ground carefully, but found no descending tracks. He
returned to the summit and, looking more closely than at first, discovered where the
bird had flown away from a point on the eastern edge of the summit and gone apparently
toward the east.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">515.</span> The Navaho sat down, sad and lonely, and wept. &#x201c;Dear pet,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;would that I
had taken you with me that day when I set out on my journey. Had I done so I should
not have lost you. Dear pet, you were the black cloud; you were the black mist; you
were the beautiful he-rain;<a href="#not225" class="noteref">225</a> you were the beautiful she-rain;<a href="#not137" class="noteref">137</a> you were the beautiful lightning; you were the beautiful rainbow; you were the beautiful
white corn; you were the beautiful blue corn; you were the beautiful yellow corn;
you were the beautiful corn of all colors; you were the beautiful bean. Though lost
to me, you shall be of use to men, upon the earth, in the days to come&#x2014;they shall
use your feathers and your beard in their rites.&#x201d; The Navaho never saw his pet again;
it had flown to the east, and from it we think the tame turkeys of the white men are
descended. But all the useful and beautiful things he saw in his pet are still to
be seen in the turkey. It has the colors of all the different kinds of corn in its
feathers. The black of the black mist and the black cloud are there. The flash of
the lightning and the gleam of the rainbow are seen on its plumes when it walks in
the sun. The rain is in its beard; the bean it carries on its forehead.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">516.</span> He dried his tears, descended the mountain, and sought his old hut, which was only
a poor shelter of brush, and then he went to visit his farm. He found his corn with
ears already formed and all the other plants well advanced toward maturity.<a href="#not226" class="noteref">226</a> He pulled one ear from a stalk of each one of the four different kinds of corn, and,
wrapping the ears in his mantle of wood-rat skins, went off to see his wife. She saw
him coming, met him at the door, and relieved him of his weapons and bundle. &#x201c;What
is this?&#x201d; she said, pointing to the bundle after she had laid it down. He opened it.
She started back in amazement. She had never seen corn before. He laid the ears down
side by side in a row with their points to the east, and said: &#x201c;This is what we call
na<i>t</i>á<i>n</i>, corn. This (pointing to the first ear&#x2014;the most northerly of the row) is white corn;
this (pointing to the next) is blue corn; this (pointing to the third) is yellow corn,
and this (pointing to the fourth) is corn of all colors.&#x201d;<a href="#not227" class="noteref">227</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>&#x201c;And what do your people do with it?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;We eat it,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;How do
you prepare it to eat?&#x201d; she inquired. He said: &#x201c;We have four ways when it is green
like this. We put it, husk and all, in hot coals to roast. We take off the husk and
roast it in hot ashes. We boil it whole in hot water. We cut off the grains and mix
it with water to make mush.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">517.</span> She wrapped the four ears in a bundle and carried them to the other lodge to show
them to her parents. Both were astonished and alarmed. The old man rose and shaded
his eyes with his open hand to look at them. They asked her questions about the corn,
such as she had asked her husband, and she answered them as he had answered her. She
cooked the four ears of corn, each one in a different way, according to the methods
her husband described. They increased in cooking so that they made food enough to
furnish a hearty meal for all. The old people, who were greatly pleased, said the
mush smelled like fawn-cheese.<a href="#not228" class="noteref">228</a> &#x201c;Where does my son-in-law get this fine stuff? Ask him. I wish to know, it is so
delicious. Does he not want some himself?&#x201d; said the old man to his daughter. She brought
a large dish of the corn to her husband in the other lodge, and they ate it together.
The Navaho had no fear of poison this time, for the food did not belong to the old
man.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">518.</span> At night when they were alone together she asked him where he got the corn. &#x201c;I found
it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Did you dig it out of the ground?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;No. I picked it up,&#x201d;
was his answer. Not believing him, she continued to question him until at last he
told her: &#x201c;These things I plant and they grow where I plant them. Do you wish to see
my field?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, if my father will let me,&#x201d; the woman replied.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">519.</span> Next morning she told her father what she had found out on the previous night and
asked his advice. He said he would like to have her go with Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani to see what the farm looked like and to find out what kind of leaves the plant
had that such food grew on. When she came back from her father&#x2019;s lodge she brought
with her pemmican made of venison and a basket of mush. The Wind People whispered
to him that he need not fear the food to-day, so he ate heartily of it. When the breakfast
was over, the Navaho said: &#x201c;Dress yourself for the journey, and as soon as you are
ready I shall take you to my farm.&#x201d; She dressed herself for travel and went to the
lodge of her parents, where she said: &#x201c;I go with my husband now.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is well,&#x201d; they
said; &#x201c;go with him.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">520.</span> The Navaho and his wife set out together. When they came to a little hill from which
they could first see the field, they beheld the sun shining on it; yet the rain was
falling on it at the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>time, and above it was a dark cloud spanned by a rainbow. When they reached the field
they walked four times around it sunwise, and as they went he described things in
the field to his wife. &#x201c;This is my white corn, this is my blue corn, this is my yellow
corn, and this is my corn of all colors. These we call squashes, these we call melons,
and these we call beans,&#x201d; he said, pointing to the various plants. The bluebirds and
the yellowbirds were singing in the corn after the rain, and all was beautiful. She
was pleased and astonished and she asked many questions,&#x2014;how the seeds were planted,
how the food was prepared and eaten,&#x2014;and he answered all her questions. &#x201c;These on
the ground are melons; they are not ripe yet. When they are ripe we eat them raw,&#x201d;
he explained. When they had circled four times around the field they went in among
the plants. Then he showed her the pollen and explained its sacred uses.<a href="#not11" class="noteref">11</a> He told her how the corn matured; how his people husked it and stored it for winter
use, how they shelled, ground, and prepared it, and how they preserved some to sow
in the spring. &#x201c;Now, let us pluck an ear of each kind of corn and go home,&#x201d; he said.
When she plucked the corn she also gathered three of the leaves and put them into
the same bundle with the corn; but as they walked home the leaves increased in number,
and when she got to the house and untied the bundle she found not only three, but
many leaves in it.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">521.</span> He explained to her how to make the dish now known to the Navahoes as <i>d</i>&#x12d;<i>t</i>lógi klesán,<a href="#not230" class="noteref">230</a> and told her to make this of the white corn. He instructed her how to prepare corn
as <i>d</i>&#x12d;<i>t</i>lóg&#x12d;n t<i>s</i>&#x12d;d&#x12d;kói,<a href="#not231" class="noteref">231</a> and told her to make this of the blue corn. He showed her how to prepare corn in
the form of <i>t</i><i>h</i>áb&#x12d;t<i>s</i>a,<a href="#not232" class="noteref">232</a> or three-ears, and bade her make this of the yellow corn. He told her to roast, in
the husk, the ear of many colors. She took the corn to the other lodge and prepared
it as she had been directed. In cooking, it all increased greatly in amount, so that
they all had a big meal out of four ears.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">522.</span> The old people questioned their daughter about the farm&#x2014;what it looked like, what
grew there. They asked her many questions. She told them of all she had seen and heard:
of her distant view of the beautiful farm under the rain, under the black cloud, under
the rainbow; of her near view of it&#x2014;the great leaves, the white blossoms of the bean,
the yellow blossoms of the squash, the tassel of the corn, the silk of the corn, the
pollen of the corn, and all the other beautiful things she saw there. When she had
done the old man said: &#x201c;I thank you, my daughter, for bringing me such a son-in-law.
I have travelled far, but I have never seen such things as those you tell of. I thought
I was rich, but my son-in-law is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>richer. In future cook these things with care, in the way my son-in-law shows you.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">523.</span> The old man then went to see his son-in-law and said: &#x201c;I thank you for the fine food
you have brought us, and I am glad to hear you have such a beautiful farm. You know
how to raise and cook corn; but do you know how to make and cook the pemmican<a href="#not229" class="noteref">229</a> of the deer?&#x201d; &#x201c;I know nothing about it,&#x201d; said the Navaho. (The one knew nothing of
venison; the other knew nothing of corn.) &#x201c;How does it taste to you?&#x201d; asked the old
man. &#x201c;I like the taste of it and I thank you for what you have given me,&#x201d; replied
the Navaho. &#x201c;Your wife, then, will have something to tell you.&#x201d; When he got back to
the other lodge he said: &#x201c;My son-in-law has been kind to us; he has shown you his
farm and taught you how to prepare his food. My daughter, now we must show him our
farm.&#x201d; She brought to her husband a large portion of the cooked corn.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">524.</span> When night came and they were alone together she asked him to tell her his name.
&#x201c;I have no name,&#x201d; he replied. Three times he answered her thus. When she asked for
the fourth time he said: &#x201c;Why do you wish to know my name? I have two names. I am
Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani, He Who Teaches Himself, and I am Á<i>h</i>o<i>d</i>&#x12d;se<i>l</i>i, He Who Has Floated. Now that I have told you my name you must tell me your father&#x2019;s
name.&#x201d; &#x201c;He is called Pí<i>n</i>il<i>t</i>ani, Deer Raiser. I am Pí<i>n</i>il<i>t</i>ani-bitsí, Deer Raiser&#x2019;s Daughter, and my mother is Pí<i>n</i>il<i>t</i>ani-baád, She Deer Raiser,&#x201d; the young woman answered.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">525.</span> In the morning after this conversation they had a breakfast of mush and venison;
but Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani received no warning from the Wind People and feared not to eat. When the meal
was over, the young woman said to her husband: &#x201c;My father has told me that, as you
have shown me your farm, I may now show you his farm. If you wish to go there, you
must first bathe your body in yucca-suds and then rinse off in pure water.&#x201d; After
he had taken his bath as directed he picked up his old sandals and was about to put
them on when she stopped him, saying: &#x201c;No. You wore your own clothes when you went
to your own farm. Now you must wear our clothes when you come to our farm.&#x201d; She gave
him embroidered moccasins; fringed buckskin leggings; a buckskin shirt, dyed yellow,
beautifully embroidered with porcupine quills, and fringed with stripes of otter-skin;
and a headdress adorned with artificial ears called T<i>s</i>áha<i>d</i>olkohi&#x2014;they wore such in the old days, and there are men still living who have seen
them worn.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">526.</span> Dressed in these fine garments he set out with his wife and they travelled toward
the southeast. As they were passing the other hut she bade him wait outside while
she went in to procure a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>wand of turquoise. They went but a short distance (about three hundred yards)<a href="#not233" class="noteref">233</a> when they came, on the top of a small hill, to a large, smooth stone, adorned with
turquoise, sticking in the ground like a stopple in a water-jar. She touched this
rock stopple with her wand in four different directions&#x2014;east, south, west, north&#x2014;and
it sprang up out of the ground. She touched it in an upward direction, and it lay
over on its side, revealing a hole which led to a flight of four stone steps.
</p>
<p id="par527"><span class="parNum">527.</span> She entered the hole and beckoned to him to follow. When they descended the steps
they found themselves in a square apartment with four doors of rock crystal, one on
each side. There was a rainbow over each door. With her wand she struck the eastern
door and it flew open, disclosing a vast and beautiful country, like this world, but
more beautiful. How vast it was the Navaho knew not, for he could not see the end
of it. They passed through the door. The land was filled with deer and covered with
beautiful flowers. The air was filled with the odor of pollen and the odor of fragrant
blossoms. Birds of the most beautiful plumage were flying in the air, perching on
the flowers, and building nests in the antlers of the deer. In the distance a light
shower of rain was falling, and rainbows shone in every direction. &#x201c;This, then, is
the farm of my father-in-law which you promised to show me,&#x201d; said the Navaho. &#x201c;It
is beautiful; but in truth it is no farm, for I see nothing planted here.&#x201d; She took
him into three other apartments. They were all as beautiful as the first, but they
contained different animals. In the apartment to the south there were antelope; in
that to the west, Rocky Mountain sheep; in that to the north, elk.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">528.</span> When they closed the last door and came out to the central apartment they found Deer
Raiser there. &#x201c;Has my son-in-law been in all the rooms and seen all the game?&#x201d; he
asked. &#x201c;I have seen all,&#x201d; said Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani. &#x201c;Do you see two sacrificial cigarettes of the deer above the rainbow over the
eastern door?&#x201d; &#x201c;I see them now,&#x201d; responded the Navaho, &#x201c;but I did not notice them
when I entered.&#x201d; The old man then showed him, over the door in the south, two cigarettes
of the antelope; over the door in the west, two cigarettes of the Rocky Mountain sheep;
over the door in the north, the single white cigarette of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i<a href="#not234" class="noteref">234</a> (the elk had no cigarette), and at the bottom of the steps by which they had entered,
two cigarettes of the fawn. &#x201c;Look well at these cigarettes,&#x201d; said the old man, &#x201c;and
remember how they are painted, for such we now sacrifice in our ceremonies.&#x201d; &#x201c;Are
you pleased?&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you admire what you have seen?&#x201d; &#x201c;What do you think of it all?&#x201d; Such
were the questions the old man asked, and the Navaho made answer: &#x201c;I thank you. I
am glad that I have seen your farm and your pets. Such things I never saw before.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">529.</span> &#x201c;Now, my daughter,&#x201d; said Deer Raiser, &#x201c;catch a deer for my son-in-law, that we may
have fresh meat.&#x201d; She opened the eastern door, entered, and caught a big buck by the
foot (just as we catch sheep in these days). She pulled it out. The Navaho walked
in front; the young woman, dragging the buck, came after him, and the old man came
last of all, closing the doors and putting in the stopple as he came. They brought
the buck home, tied its legs together with short rainbows, cut its throat with a stone
arrow point, and skinned it as we now skin deer.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">530.</span> Now Deer Raiser began again to plot the death of his son-in-law. He found he could
not poison him, so he determined to try another plan. In a neighboring canyon, to
which there was but one entrance, he kept four fierce pet bears. He determined to
invite his son-in-law out to hunt with him, and get him killed by these bears. The
rest of that day the Navaho remained at home with his wife, while the old man took
the hoofs of the slain deer and made with them a lot of tracks leading into the canyon
of the bears.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">531.</span> On the following morning, while the young woman was cooking in the other lodge, Deer
Raiser came in where the Navaho sat and said: &#x201c;My son-in-law, four of my pet deer
have escaped from the farm. I have tracked them to a canyon near by, which has only
one entrance. As soon as you have eaten I want you to help me to hunt them. You will
stand at the entrance of the canyon while I go in to drive the deer toward you, and
you can kill them as they come out. No,&#x201d; said the old man after pausing for a while
and pretending to think, &#x201c;you must go into the canyon, my son-in-law, while I stay
at the entrance and kill the deer. That will be better.&#x201d; When about to start on his
hunt, the Wind People whispered to the Navaho: &#x201c;Do not enter the canyon.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">532.</span> The two men walked along the steep side of the valley, following the tracks until
they came to the high rugged cliffs that marked the entrance to the canyon. &#x201c;When
my deer escape, here is where they usually come,&#x201d; said Deer Raiser. A little stream
of water ran out of the canyon, and here the old man had raised a dam to make a pool.
When they reached the pool he said: &#x201c;Here I shall stop to shoot the deer. Go you in
and drive them out for me.&#x201d; &#x201c;No, I fear the deer will pass me,&#x201d; said Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani. Four times these words were said by both. At last the old man, seeing that his
companion was obstinate, said: &#x201c;Stay here, then, but do not let the deer escape you,
and do not climb the hillsides around for fear the deer should see you,&#x201d; and he went
himself into the canyon. In spite of all the warnings he had received, Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani climbed a rocky eminence where he could watch and be out of danger. After waiting
a while in silence he heard a distant cry like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>that of a wolf,<a href="#not235" class="noteref">235</a> woo-oo-oo-oo, and became aware that something was moving toward him through the brush.
He soon descried four bears walking down the canyon in single file, about thirty paces
apart, alternately a female and a male. The old man had probably told them there was
some one for them to kill, for they advanced with hair bristling, snouts up, and teeth
showing. When he saw them coming he said, &#x201c;I am Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni. I am <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i. I am <i>S</i>a<i>s</i>nalkáhi. I am a god of bears,&#x201d; and he mentioned the names of other potent gods. As
the bears were passing their hidden enemy he drew arrow after arrow to the head and
slew them all, one by one. He killed them as they walked along a ledge of rock, and
their bodies tumbled down on the other side of the ledge, where they were hidden from
view. Soon the voice of the old man was heard in the distance crying: &#x201c;Oh, my pets!
Oh, T<i>s</i>ananaí! Oh, T<i>s</i>&#x115;&#x2032;sko<i>d</i>i! (for the bears had names).<a href="#not236" class="noteref">236</a> Save a piece for me! Save a piece for me!&#x201d; And a little later he came in sight, running
and panting. He did not see his son-in-law till he was right beside him. He showed
at once that he was surprised and angry, but he quickly tried to make it appear that
he was angry from another cause. &#x201c;I should have been here. You have let them run by,&#x201d;
he cried in angry tones. &#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; said the Navaho, &#x201c;I have not let them run by. I
have killed them. Look over the ledge and you will see them.&#x201d; The old man looked as
he was told, and was struck dumb with astonishment and sorrow. He sat down in silence,
with his head hanging between his knees, and gazed at the bodies of his dead pets.
He did not even thank his son-in-law.<a href="#not237" class="noteref">237</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">533.</span> Why did Deer Raiser seek the life of his son-in-law? Now Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani knew, and now you shall know. The old man was a <i>d</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb;yiani, or man-eater, and a wizard. He wanted the flesh of the Navaho to eat, and
he wanted parts of the dead body to use in the rites of witchcraft. But there was
yet another reason; he was jealous of the Navaho, for those who practise witchcraft
practise also incest.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">534.</span> &#x201c;Why did you shoot them?&#x201d; said the old man at last; &#x201c;the deer went out before them.
Why did you not shoot the deer? Now you may skin the bears.&#x201d; &#x201c;You never drove deer
to me,&#x201d; said the Navaho. &#x201c;These are what you drove to me. When a companion in the
hunt drives anything to me I kill it, no matter what it is. You have talked much to
me about hunting with you. Now I have killed game and you must skin it.&#x201d; &#x201c;Help me,
then, to skin it,&#x201d; said Deer Raiser. &#x201c;No. I never skin the game I kill myself.<a href="#not238" class="noteref">238</a> You must do the skinning. I killed for you,&#x201d; said the Navaho. &#x201c;If you will not help
me,&#x201d; said the old man, &#x201c;go back to the house and tell my daughter to come and assist
me to skin the bears. Go back by the way we came when we trailed the deer.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">535.</span> Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani set off as the Deer Raiser had directed him. As soon as he was out of sight the
old man rushed for the house by a short cut. Reaching home, he hastily dressed himself
in the skin of a great serpent, went to the trail which his son-in-law was to take,
and lay in ambush behind a log at a place where the path led through a narrow defile.
As the Navaho approached the log the Wind People told him: &#x201c;Your father-in-law awaits
you behind the log.&#x201d; The Navaho peeped over the log before he got too near, and saw
Deer Raiser in his snake-skin suit, swaying uneasily back and forth, poising himself
as if preparing to spring. When he saw the young man looking in his direction he crouched
low. &#x201c;What are you doing there?&#x201d; called the Navaho (in a way which let Deer Raiser
know he was recognized),<a href="#not239" class="noteref">239</a> and he drew an arrow on the old man. &#x201c;Stop! stop!&#x201d; cried the latter. &#x201c;I only came
here to meet you and hurry you up.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why do you not come from behind, if that is so?
Why do you come from before me and hide beside my path?&#x201d; said the Navaho, and he passed
on his way and went to his wife&#x2019;s house.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">536.</span> When Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani reached the house he told his wife that he had killed four animals for his father-in-law,
but he did not tell her what kind of animals they were, and he told her that her father
sent for her mother to help skin the animals and cut up the meat. The daughter delivered
the message to her mother, and the latter went out to the canyon to help her husband.
When Deer Raiser saw his wife coming he was furious. &#x201c;It was my daughter I sent for,
not you,&#x201d; he roared. &#x201c;What sort of a man is he who cannot carry my word straight,
who cannot do as he is told? I bade him tell my daughter, not you, to come to me.&#x201d;
Between them they skinned and dressed the bears and carried them, one at a time, to
his house. He sent to his son-in-law to know if he wanted some meat, and the Navaho
replied that he did not eat bear meat. When he heard this, Deer Raiser was again furious,
and said: &#x201c;What manner of a man is this who won&#x2019;t eat meat? (He did not say what kind
of meat.) When we offer him food he says he does not want to eat it. He never does
what he is told to do. We cook food for him and he refuses it. What can we do to please
him? What food will satisfy him?&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">537.</span> The next morning after the bears were killed, the young woman went out as usual,
and the old man entered during her absence. He said to Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani: &#x201c;I wish you to go out with me to-day and help me to fight my enemies. There are
enemies of mine, not far from here, whom I sometimes meet in battle.&#x201d; &#x201c;I will go with
you,&#x201d; said the Navaho. &#x201c;I have long been hoping that some one would say something
like this to me,&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">538.</span> They went from the lodge toward a mountain which was edged on two sides by steep
cliffs, which no man could climb. On the top of the mountain the old man said there
was a round hole or valley in which his enemies dwelled. He stationed his son-in-law
on one side of this round valley where no cliffs were, and he went to the opposite
side to drive the enemy, as he said. He promised to join the Navaho when the enemy
started. Deer Raiser went around the mountain and cried four times in imitation of
a wolf. Then, instead of coming to his comrade&#x2019;s help, he ran around the base of the
hill and got behind his son-in-law. Soon after the old man made his cry, the Navaho
saw twelve great ferocious bears coming toward him over the crest of the hill. They
were of the kind called <i>s</i>a<i>s</i>nalkáhi, or tracking bears, such as scent and track a man, and follow till they kill
him. They were of all the sacred colors,&#x2014;white, blue, yellow, black, and spotted.
They came toward the Navaho, but he was well armed and prepared to meet them. He fought
with them the hardest fight he ever fought; but at length he killed them all, and
suffered no harm himself.<a href="#not240" class="noteref">240</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">539.</span> In the mean time the old man ran off in the direction of his home, sure that his
son-in-law was killed. He said: &#x201c;I think we shall hear no more of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani. I think we shall hear no more of Á<i>h</i>o<i>d</i>&#x12d;se<i>l</i>i. Hereafter it will be Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>anini (the dead Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani). Hereafter it will be Á<i>h</i>o<i>d</i>&#x12d;se<i>l</i>ini (the dead Á<i>h</i>o<i>d</i>&#x12d;se<i>l</i>i).<a href="#not241" class="noteref">241</a> He can&#x2019;t come back out of the tracking bears&#x2019; mouths.&#x201d; After killing the bears, the
Navaho found the old man&#x2019;s trail and followed it. Presently he came to Deer Raiser,
who was sitting on a knoll. The old man could not conceal his astonishment at seeing
the Navaho still alive. &#x201c;When we went out to this battle,&#x201d; said the young man, &#x201c;we
promised not to desert one another. Why did you run away from me?&#x201d; The Deer Raiser
answered: &#x201c;I am sorry I could not find you. I did not see where you were, so I came
on this way. What did you do where I left you? Did you kill any of the bears?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes,
I killed all of them,&#x201d; said Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani. &#x201c;I am glad you killed all and came away with your own life, my dear son-in-law,&#x201d;
said the old cheat.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">540.</span> They started to walk home together, but night fell when they reached a rocky ridge
on the way; here they picked out a nice spot of ground to sleep on, built a shelter
of brushwood, and made a fire. Before they went to rest the old man said: &#x201c;This is
a bad place to camp. It is called Ked&#x12d;d&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>yena&#x2bb;a&#x2bb; (Ridge of the Burnt Moccasins).&#x201d; As they lay down to sleep, one on either
side of the fire, each took off his moccasins and put them under his head. The old
man said: &#x201c;Take good care of your moccasins, my son-in-law. Place them securely.&#x201d;
&#x201c;Why does he say these things?&#x201d; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>asked the Navaho to himself. As he lay awake, thinking of the warning of the old man,
he heard the latter snoring. He rose softly, took away the old man&#x2019;s moccasins, put
his own in their place, and lay down to sleep with Deer Raiser&#x2019;s moccasins under his
head. Later in the night the old man got up, pulled the moccasins from under the young
man&#x2019;s head, and buried them in the hot embers. He was anxious to get home next morning
before his son-in-law.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">541.</span> At dawn the old man aroused his companion with &#x201c;It is time we were on our road.&#x201d;
The young man woke, rubbed his eyes, yawned, and pretended to look for his moccasins.
After searching a while he asked: &#x201c;Where are my moccasins? Have I lost them?&#x201d; &#x201c;Huh!&#x201d;
said Deer Raiser. &#x201c;You did not listen to what I told you last night. I said that this
was the Ridge of the Burned Moccasins.&#x201d; In the mean time, on the other side of the
fire, the old man was putting on his companion&#x2019;s moccasins, not noticing that they
were not his own. &#x201c;Look. You are putting on my moccasins instead of your own. Give
me my moccasins,&#x201d; said the Navaho, reaching across the fire. He took them out of his
companion&#x2019;s hands, sat down and put them on. &#x201c;Now we must hurry back,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I
can&#x2019;t see what made you burn your moccasins, but I cannot wait for you. I am going
now.&#x201d;<a href="#not242" class="noteref">242</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">542.</span> Before the young man left, his father-in-law gave him a message. &#x201c;I cannot travel
as fast as you on my bare feet. When you go home, tell my daughter to come out with
a pair of moccasins and some food, and meet me on the trail.&#x201d; When the Navaho got
home he said to his wife: &#x201c;I camped with your father last night, and he burned his
moccasins. He is limping home barefoot. He bids his wife to come out and meet him
with moccasins and food.&#x201d; The daughter delivered the message to her mother, and the
latter went out to meet her husband with moccasins, food, and a brand of burning cedar-bark.
When the old man met her he was angry. &#x201c;Why have you come? Why has not my daughter
come?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Your son-in-law said that I should come,&#x201d; the old woman replied.
&#x201c;Oh, what a fool my son-in-law is,&#x201d; cried Deer Raiser. &#x201c;He never can remember what
he is told to say.&#x201d; He ate his food, put on his moccasins, and hurried home with his
wife.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">543.</span> When Deer Raiser visited his son-in-law on the following morning he said: &#x201c;I warn
you never to stray alone to the east of the lodge in which you dwell. There is a dangerous
place there.&#x201d; The old man went home, and the Navaho pondered all day over what his
father-in-law had said, and during the night he made up his mind to do just what the
old man had told him not to do.
</p>
<p id="par544"><span class="parNum">544.</span> When Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani had eaten in the morning he dressed himself for a journey, left the lodge, and
travelled straight to the east. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>He came to a steep white ridge;<a href="#not243" class="noteref">243</a> when he had climbed this about half way, he observed approaching him a man of low
stature. His coat, which fitted him skin-tight, was white on the chest and insides
of the arms, while it was brown elsewhere, like the skin of a deer. He wore on his
head a deer-mask, with horns, such as deer-hunters use. He carried a turquoise wand,
a black bow with sinew on the back, and two arrows with featherings of eagle-tail.
He was one of the Ts&#x12d;das<i>t</i>ói<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb;.<a href="#not244" class="noteref">244</a> When the men met, the stranger, who had a pale face,<a href="#not245" class="noteref">245</a> looked out from under his mask and said: &#x201c;Whence come you, my grandchild?&#x201d; &#x201c;I come,
my grandfather, from a place near here. I come from the house of Pí<i>n</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>ani,&#x201d; the Navaho answered. &#x201c;My grandchild, I have heard of you. Do you know how my
cigarette is made?&#x201d; said the man with the deer-mask. &#x201c;No, my grandfather, I never
heard of your cigarette,&#x201d; was the reply. &#x201c;There is a cigarette<a href="#not12" class="noteref">12</a> for me, my grandson,&#x201d; said the stranger. &#x201c;It is painted white, with a black spot
on it, and is so long (second joint of middle finger). It should be laid in the fork
of a piñon-tree. I am now walking out, and am going in the direction whence you came.
There are people living behind the ridge you are climbing. You should visit them,
and hear what they will have to tell you.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">545.</span> The Navaho climbed the ridge; and as he began to descend it on the other side, he
observed below him two conical tents, such as the Indians of the plains use. The tents
were white below and yellow above, representing the dawn and the evening twilight.
As he approached the tents he observed that two games of nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i> were being played,&#x2014;one beside each tent,&#x2014;and a number of people were gathered, watching
the games. As he advanced toward the crowd a man came forward to meet him, saying:
&#x201c;Go to the lodge in the south. There are many people there.&#x201d; He went to the lodge
in the south, as he was bidden. A woman of bright complexion, fairer than the Navahoes
usually are, the wife of the owner of the lodge, came out and invited him to enter.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">546.</span> When Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani entered the lodge he found its owner seated in the middle. The latter was a man
past middle age, but not very old. He was dressed in a beautiful suit of buckskin
embroidered with porcupine quills. He pointed to a place by his side, and said to
the Navaho: &#x201c;Sit here, my grandchild.&#x201d; When the Navaho was seated his host said: &#x201c;Whence
do you come? The people who live up on the earth are never seen here.&#x201d; &#x201c;I come from
the house of Pí<i>n</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>ani,&#x201d; the young man answered. &#x201c;Oh! Do you?&#x201d; questioned the host. &#x201c;And do you know
that Deer Raiser is a great villain; that he kills his guests; that he talks softly,
and pretends friendship, and lures people to stay with him until he can quietly kill
them? Has he never spoken thus softly to you? How <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>long have you been staying with him?&#x201d; &#x201c;I have dwelt with him for many days,&#x201d; Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani answered. &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; said his host. &#x201c;Many of our young men have gone over there to
woo his daughter; but they have never returned. Some are killed on the first day;
others on the second day; others on the third day; others on the fourth; but no one
ever lives beyond the fourth day. No one has ever lived there as long as you have.&#x201d;
&#x201c;He seems to be such a man as you describe him,&#x201d; said Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani. &#x201c;He has been trying to kill me ever since I have been with him.&#x201d; &#x201c;You must be
a wise man to have escaped him so long; your prayer must be potent; your charm must
be strong,&#x201d;<a href="#not246" class="noteref">246</a> declared the host. &#x201c;No, truly, I know no good prayer; I possess no charm,&#x201d; the Navaho
replied, and then he went on to tell how he came into that country, and all that happened
to him, till he came to the house of Deer Raiser. &#x201c;He is rich, but he is no good.
That daughter of his is also his wife, and that is why he wants to poison her suitors,&#x201d;
said the owner of the lodge, and then he described four ways in which Pí<i>n</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>ani killed his guests. The Navaho remained silent. He knew all the ways of the Deer
Raiser, but he pretended not to know. Then the host went on: &#x201c;The house of Deer Raiser
is a place of danger. You will surely be killed if you stay there. I am sorry you
are in such bad company, for you seem to be a good man.&#x201d; &#x201c;You speak of Deer Raiser
as a great man; but he cannot be so great as you think he is. Four times have I killed
him with smoke, and four times have I brought him to life again,&#x201d; said the Navaho,
and then he related all his adventures since he had been with Pí<i>n</i>&#x12d;l<i>t</i>ani.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">547.</span> The host thanked him for having slain the bears, and went out to call the players
and all the crowd that stood around them to come to his tent. They came, for he was
their chief, and soon the tent was crowded. Then he spoke to the assembly, and told
them the story of the Navaho. There was great rejoicing when they heard it. They thanked
Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani for what he had done. One said that Deer Raiser had killed his brother; another
said he had killed his son; another said the bears had slain his nephew, and thus
they spoke of their many woes.
</p>
<p id="par548"><span class="parNum">548.</span> The people were of five kinds, or gentes: the Puma People, the Blue Fox People, the
Yellow Fox People, the Wolf People, and the Lynx People, and the host was chief of
all.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">549.</span> The chief ordered one of his daughters to prepare food for the visitor. She brought
in deer pemmican. The Navaho ate, and when he was done he said: &#x201c;I am now ready to
go, my grandfather.&#x201d; &#x201c;Wait a while,&#x201d; said the chief. &#x201c;I have some medicine to give
you. It is an antidote for Deer Raiser&#x2019;s poison.&#x201d; He gave his visitor two kinds of
medicine; one was an object the size of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>last two joints of the little finger, made of the gall of birds of prey,&#x2014;all birds
that catch with their claws; the other was a small quantity (as much as one might
grasp with the tips of all the fingers of one hand) of a substance composed of material
vomited by each of the five animals that were the totems of this people. &#x201c;Now have
no fear,&#x201d; said the chief. &#x201c;The bears are slain, and you have here medicines that will
kill the wizard&#x2019;s poison. They are potent against witchcraft.&#x201d;<a href="#not247" class="noteref">247</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">550.</span> When the Navaho went back to the house where his wife was, she said: &#x201c;My father has
been here inquiring for you. When I told him you had gone to the east he was very
angry, and said that he told you not to go there.&#x201d; Soon the old man entered and said
fiercely: &#x201c;Why have you gone to the east? I told you not to go there. I told you it
was a bad place.&#x201d; The young man made no reply, but acted as if he had seen and heard
nothing while he was gone, and in a little while Deer Raiser calmed down and acted
as if he wished to be at peace again with his son-in-law; but before he left he warned
him not to go to the south. Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani pondered on the words of his father-in-law that night, and made up his mind to
again disobey him when morning came.
</p>
<p id="par551"><span class="parNum">551.</span> Next day, when he had eaten, he dressed himself for a journey and walked toward the
south. He came, in time, to a blue ridge, and when he was ascending it he met a little
man, much like the one he had met the day before, but he had a bluish face. Instead
of being dressed to look like a deer, he was dressed to look like an antelope; he
wore an antelope hunting-mask with horns, he carried a wand of haliotis, and a bow
made of a wood called ts&#x115;<i>l</i>káni, with no sinew on the back, and he had arrows trimmed with the tail feathers
of the red-tailed buzzard.<a href="#not248" class="noteref">248</a> Like the little man of the east, he was also one of the Ts&#x12d;das<i>t</i>ói People. He told the Navaho how to make the cigarette that belonged to him, to make
it the length of the middle joint of the little finger, to paint it blue, spot it
with yellow, and deposit it in the fork of a cedar-tree. The little man told the Navaho
to go on over the ridge till he came to two lodges and to listen there to what the
people would tell him. He went and found two lodges, and people playing nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i>, and had all things happen to him nearly the same as happened to him in the east.
When he returned home he had again an angry talk from his father-in-law, and was warned
not to go to the west; but again he determined to pay no heed to the warning.
</p>
<p id="par552"><span class="parNum">552.</span> When he went to the west, next day, he found a yellow ridge to cross. The little
man whom he met had a yellowish face; he was armed and dressed the same as the little
man of the east, except that he had no horns on his deer-mask, for he represented
a doe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>He described to the Navaho how to make a cigarette sacred to himself, which was to
be painted yellow, spotted with blue, and deposited in a piñon-tree, like the cigarette
of the east. Other events happened much as on the two previous days.
</p>
<p id="par553"><span class="parNum">553.</span> On the fourth of these forbidden journeys the Navaho went to the north. The ridge
which he had to cross was black. The little man whom he met was armed and dressed
like the man in the south, but he had no horns on his mask. His face was very dark.
The cigarette which he described was to be painted black and spotted with white; it
was to be the same length as the cigarette of the south, and disposed of in the same
way.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">554.</span> When he got home from his fourth journey, his father-in-law came into the lodge and
reviled him once more with angry words; but this time the Navaho did not remain silent.
He told the old man where he had been, what people he had met, what stories he had
heard, and all that he knew of him. He told him, too, that he had learned of cigarettes,
and medicines, and charms, and rites to protect him against a wizard&#x2019;s power. &#x201c;You
have killed others,&#x201d; said Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani, &#x201c;you have tried to kill me. I knew it all the time, but said nothing. Now I know
all of your wickedness.&#x201d; &#x201c;All that you say is true,&#x201d; said the old man; &#x201c;but I shall
seek your life no more, and I shall give up all my evil ways. While you were abroad
on your journeys you learned of powerful sacrifices, and rites, and medicines. All
that I ask is that you will treat me with these.&#x201d; His son-in-law did as he was desired,
and in doing so performed the first atsósi <span class="corr" id="xd29e10751" title="Source: hatál"><i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i></span>.<a href="#not249" class="noteref">249</a>

<p><span class="parNum">555.</span> After treating his father-in-law, Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani returned to his people, taught them all he had learned while he was gone, and
thus established the rite of atsósi <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> among the Navahoes. Then he went back to the whirling lake of <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nihili<i>n</i>, and he dwells there still.

They are ruins now; but in the days when
Ki<i>n</i>níki lived on earth many people dwelt there. Not far from the ruins is a high cliff
called Tse&#x2bb;dezá&#x2bb;, or Standing Rock. Near these places the rite of yói <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>,<a href="#not250" class="noteref">250</a> or the bead chant, was first practised by the Navahoes, and this is the tale of how

<p><span class="parNum">557.</span> Two young men, one from K&#x12d;ntyél and one from K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i>, went out one day to hunt deer. About sunset, as they were returning to K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i>, weary and unsuccessful, they observed a war-eagle soaring overhead, and they stopped
to watch his flight. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>moved slowly away, growing smaller and smaller to their gaze until at length he dwindled
to a black speck, almost invisible; and while they strained their sight to get a last
look he seemed to them to descend on the top of Standing Rock. In order to mark the
spot where they last saw him they cut a forked stick, stuck it in the ground fork
upward, and arranged it so that when they should look over it again, crouching in
a certain position, their sight would be guided to the spot. They left the stick standing
and went home to K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i>.<a href="#not251" class="noteref">251</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">558.</span> In those days eagles were very scarce in the land; it was a wonder to see one; so
when the young men got home and told the story of their day&#x2019;s adventures, it became
the subject of much conversation and counsel, and at length the people determined
to send four men, in the morning, to take sight over the forked stick, in order to
find out where the eagle lived.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">559.</span> Next morning early the four men designated went to the forked stick and sighted over
it, and all came to the conclusion that the eagle lived on the point of Tse&#x2bb;dezá&#x2bb;.
They went at once to the rock, climbed to the summit, and saw the eagle and its young
in a cleft on the face of the precipice below them. They remained on the summit all
day and watched the nest.
</p>
<p id="par560"><span class="parNum">560.</span> At night they went home and told what they had seen. They had observed two young
eagles of different ages in the nest. Of the four men who went on the search, two
were from K&#x12d;ntyél and two were from K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i>, therefore people from the two pueblos met in counsel in an estufa, and there it
was decided that K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i> should have the elder of the two eaglets and that K&#x12d;ntyél should have the younger.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">561.</span> The only way to reach the nest was to lower a man to it with a rope; yet directly
above the nest was an overhanging ledge which the man, descending, would be obliged
to pass. It was a dangerous undertaking, and no one could be found to volunteer for
it. Living near the pueblos was a miserable Navaho beggar who subsisted on such food
as he could pick up. When the sweepings of the rooms and the ashes from the fireplaces
were thrown out on the kitchen heap, he searched eagerly through them and was happy
if he could find a few grains of corn or a piece of paper bread. He was called Nahod&#x12d;táhe,
or He Who Picks Up (like a bird). They concluded to induce this man to make the dangerous
descent.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">562.</span> They returned to the pueblo and sent for the poor Navaho to come to the estufa. When
he came they bade him be seated, placed before him a large basket of paper bread,
bowls of boiled corn and meat, with all sorts of their best food, and told him to
eat his fill. He ate as he had never eaten before, and after a long time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>he told his hosts that he was satisfied. &#x201c;You shall eat,&#x201d; said they, &#x201c;of such abundance
all your life, and never more have to scrape for grains of corn among the dirt, if
you will do as we desire.&#x201d; Then they told him of their plan for catching the young
eagles, and asked him if he were willing to be put in a basket and lowered to the
nest with a rope. He pondered and was silent. They asked him again and again until
they had asked him four times, while he still sat in meditation. At last he answered:
&#x201c;I lead but a poor life at best. Existence is not sweet to a man who always hungers.
It would be pleasant to eat such food for the rest of my days, and some time or other
I must die. I shall do as you wish.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">563.</span> On the following morning they gave him another good meal; they made a great, strong
carrying-basket with four corners at the top; they tied a strong string to each corner,
and, collecting a large party, they set out for the rock of Tse&#x2bb;dezá&#x2bb;.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">564.</span> When the party arrived at the top of the rock they tied a long, stout rope to the
four strings on the basket. They instructed the Navaho to take the eaglets out of
the nest and drop them to the bottom of the cliff. The Navaho then entered the basket
and was lowered over the edge of the precipice. They let the rope out slowly till
they thought they had lowered him far enough and then they stopped; but as he had
not yet reached the nest he called out to them to lower him farther. They did so,
and as soon as he was on a level with the nest he called to the people above to stop.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">565.</span> He was just about to grasp the eaglets and throw them down when Wind whispered to
him: &#x201c;These people of the Pueblos are not your friends. They desire not to feed you
with their good food as long as you live. If you throw these young eagles down, as
they bid you, they will never pull you up again. Get into the eagles&#x2019; nest and stay
there.&#x201d; When he heard this, he called to those above: &#x201c;Swing the basket so that it
may come nearer to the cliff. I cannot reach the nest unless you do.&#x201d; So they caused
the basket to swing back and forth. When it touched the cliff he held fast to the
rock and scrambled into the nest, leaving the empty basket swinging in the air.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">566.</span> The Pueblos saw the empty basket swinging and waited, expecting to see the Navaho
get back into it again. But when they had waited a good while and found he did not
return they began to call to him as if he were a dear relation of theirs. &#x201c;My son,&#x201d;
said the old men, &#x201c;throw down those little eagles.&#x201d; &#x201c;My elder brother! My younger
brother!&#x201d; the young men shouted, &#x201c;throw down those little eagles.&#x201d; They kept up their
clamor until nearly sunset; but they never moved the will of the Navaho. He sat in
the cleft and never answered them, and when the sun set they ceased calling and went
home.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">567.</span> In the cleft or cave, around the nest, four dead animals lay; to the east there was
a fawn; to the south a hare; to the west the young of a Rocky Mountain sheep, and
to the north a prairie-dog. From time to time, when the eaglets felt hungry, they
would leave the nest and eat of the meat; but the Navaho did not touch it.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">568.</span> Early next day the Pueblo people returned and gathered in a great crowd at the foot
of the cliff. They stayed there all day repeating their entreaties and promises, calling
the Navaho by endearing terms, and displaying all kinds of tempting food to his gaze;
but he heeded them not and spoke not.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">569.</span> They came early again on the third day, but they came in anger. They no longer called
him by friendly names; they no longer made fair promises to him; but, instead, they
shot fire-arrows at the eyry in hopes they would burn the Navaho out or set fire to
the nest and compel him to throw it and the eaglets down. But he remained watchful
and active, and whenever a fire-arrow entered the cave he seized it quickly and threw
it out. Then they abused him and reviled him, and called him bad names until sunset,
when again they went home.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">570.</span> They came again on the fourth day and acted as they had done on the previous day;
but they did not succeed in making the Navaho throw down the little eagles. He spoke
to the birds, saying: &#x201c;Can you not help me?&#x201d; They rose in the nest, shook their wings,
and threw out many little feathers, which fell on the people below. The Navaho thought
the birds must be scattering disease on his enemies. When the latter left at sunset
they said: &#x201c;Now we shall leave you where you are, to die of hunger and thirst.&#x201d; He
was then altogether three nights and nearly four days in the cave. For two days the
Pueblos had coaxed and flattered him; for two days they had cursed and reviled him,
and at the end of the fourth day they went home and left him in the cave to die.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">571.</span> When his tormentors were gone he sat in the cave hungry and thirsty, weak and despairing,
till the night fell. Soon after dark he heard a great rushing sound which approached
from one side of the entrance to the cave, roared a moment in front, and then grew
faint in the distance at the other side. Thus four times the sound came and went,
growing louder each time it passed, and at length the male Eagle lit on the eyry.
Soon the sounds were repeated, and the female bird, the mother of the eaglets, alighted.
Turning at once toward the Navaho, she said: &#x201c;Greeting, my child! Thanks, my child!
You have not thrown down your younger brother, <i>D</i>onikí.&#x201d;<a href="#not285" class="noteref">285</a> The male Eagle repeated the same words. They addressed the Navaho by the name of
<i>D</i>onikí, but afterwards they named him Ki<i>n</i>níki, after the chief of all the Eagles in the sky. He only replied to the Eagles:
&#x201c;I am hungry. I am thirsty.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p id="par572"><span class="parNum">572.</span> The male Eagle opened his sash and took out a small white cotton cloth which contained
a little corn meal, and he took out a small bowl of white shell no bigger than the
palm of the hand. When the Indian saw this he said: &#x201c;Give me water first, for I am
famishing with thirst.&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; replied the Eagle; &#x201c;eat first and then you shall have
something to drink.&#x201d; The Eagle then drew forth from among his tail feathers a small
plant called el<i>t</i>índ<i>z</i>aka<i>s</i>,<a href="#not252" class="noteref">252</a> which has many joints and grows near streams. The joints were all filled with water.
The Eagle mixed a little of the water with some of the meal in the shell and handed
the mixture to the Navaho. The latter ate and ate, until he was satisfied, but he
could not diminish in the least the contents of the shell vessel. When he was done
eating there was as much in the cup as there was when he began. He handed it back
to the Eagle, the latter emptied it with one sweep of his finger, and it remained
empty. Then the Eagle put the jointed plant to the Navaho&#x2019;s lips as if it were a wicker
bottle, and the Indian drank his fill.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">573.</span> On the previous nights, while lying in the cave, the Navaho had slept between the
eaglets in the nest to keep himself warm and shelter himself from the wind, and this
plan had been of some help to him; but on this night the great Eagles slept one on
each side of him, and he felt as warm as if he had slept among robes of fur. Before
the Eagles lay down to sleep each took off his robe of plumes, which formed a single
garment, opening in front, and revealed a form like that of a human being.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">574.</span> The Navaho slept well that night and did not waken till he heard a voice calling
from the top of the cliff: &#x201c;Where are you? The day has dawned. It is growing late.
Why are you not abroad already?&#x201d; At the sound of this voice the Eagles woke too and
put on their robes of plumage. Presently a great number of birds were seen flying
before the opening of the cave and others were heard calling to one another on the
rock overhead. There were many kinds of Eagles and Hawks in the throng. Some of all
the large birds of prey were there. Those on top of the rock sang:&#x2014;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Ki<i>n</i>nakíye, there he sits.
</p>
<p class="line">When they fly up,
</p>
<p class="line">We shall see him.
</p>
<p class="line">He will flap his wings.<a href="#not286" class="noteref">286</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first"><span class="parNum">575.</span> One of the Eagles brought a dress of eagle plumes and was about to put it on the
Navaho when the others interfered, and they had a long argument as to whether they
should dress him in the garment of the Eagles or not; but at length they all flew
away without giving him the dress. When they returned they had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>thought of another plan for taking him out of the cave. Laying him on his face, they
put a streak of crooked lightning under his feet, a sunbeam under his knees, a piece
of straight lightning under his chest, another under his outstretched hands, and a
rainbow under his forehead.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">576.</span> An Eagle then seized each end of these six supports,&#x2014;making twelve Eagles in all,&#x2014;and
they flew with the Navaho and the eaglets away from the eyry. They circled round twice
with their burden before they reached the level of the top of the cliff. They circled
round twice more ascending, and then flew toward the south, still going upwards. When
they got above the top of Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> (Mt. Taylor), they circled four times more, until they almost touched the sky. Then
they began to flag and breathed hard, and they cried out: &#x201c;We are weary. We can fly
no farther.&#x201d; The voice of one, unseen to the Navaho, cried from above: &#x201c;Let go your
burden.&#x201d; The Eagles released their hold on the supports, and the Navaho felt himself
descending swiftly toward the earth. But he had not fallen far when he felt himself
seized around the waist and chest, he felt something twining itself around his body,
and a moment later he beheld the heads of two Arrow-snakes<a href="#not258" class="noteref">258</a> looking at him over his shoulders. The Arrow-snakes bore him swiftly upwards, up
through the sky-hole, and landed him safely on the surface of the upper world above
the sky.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">577.</span> When he looked around him he observed four pueblo dwellings, or towns: a white pueblo
in the east, a blue pueblo in the south, a yellow pueblo in the west, and a black
pueblo in the north. Wolf was the chief of the eastern pueblo, Blue Fox of the southern,
Puma of the western, and Big Snake of the northern. The Navaho was left at liberty
to go where he chose, but Wind whispered into his ear and said: &#x201c;Visit, if you wish,
all the pueblos except that of the north. Chicken Hawk<a href="#not254" class="noteref">254</a> and other bad characters dwell there.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">578.</span> Next he observed that a war party was preparing, and soon after his arrival the warriors
went forth. What enemies they sought he could not learn. He entered several of the
houses, was well treated wherever he went, and given an abundance of paper bread and
other good food to eat. He saw that in their homes the Eagles were just like ordinary
people down on the lower world. As soon as they entered their pueblos they took off
their feather suits, hung these up on pegs and poles, and went around in white suits
which they wore underneath their feathers when in flight. He visited all the pueblos
except the black one in the north. In the evening the warriors returned. They were
received with loud wailing and with tears, for many who went out in the morning did
not return at night. They had been slain in battle.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">579.</span> In a few days another war party was organized, and this time the Navaho determined
to go with it. When the warriors started on the trail he followed them. &#x201c;Whither are
you going?&#x201d; they asked. &#x201c;I wish to be one of your party,&#x201d; he replied. They laughed
at him and said: &#x201c;You are a fool to think you can go to war against such dreadful
enemies as those that we fight. We can move as fast as the wind, yet our enemies can
move faster. If they are able to overcome us, what chance have you, poor man, for
your life?&#x201d; Hearing this, he remained behind, but they had not travelled far when
he hurried after them. When he overtook them, which he soon did, they spoke to him
angrily, told him more earnestly than before how helpless he was, and how great his
danger, and bade him return to the villages. Again he halted; but as soon as they
were out of sight he began to run after them, and he came up with them at the place
where they had encamped for the night. Here they gave him of their food, and again
they scolded him, and sought to dissuade him from accompanying them.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">580.</span> In the morning, when the warriors resumed their march, he remained behind on the
camping-ground, as if he intended to return; but as soon as they were out of sight
he proceeded again to follow them. He had not travelled far when he saw smoke coming
up out of the ground, and approaching the smoke he found a smoke-hole, out of which
stuck an old ladder, yellow with smoke, such as we see in the pueblo dwellings to-day.
He looked down through the hole and beheld, in a subterranean chamber beneath, a strange-looking
old woman with a big mouth. Her teeth were not set in her head evenly and regularly,
like those of an Indian; they protruded from her mouth, were set at a distance from
one another, and were curved like the claws of a bear. She was Nast<i>s</i>é Estsán, the Spider Woman. She invited him into her house, and he passed down the
ladder.
</p>
<p id="par581"><span class="parNum">581.</span> When he got inside, the Spider Woman showed him four large wooden hoops,&#x2014;one in the
east colored black, one in the south colored blue, one in the west colored yellow,
and one in the north white and sparkling. Attached to each hoop were a number of decayed,
ragged feathers. &#x201c;These feathers,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;were once beautiful plumes, but now
they are old and dirty. I want some new plumes to adorn my hoops, and you can get
them for me. Many of the Eagles will be killed in the battle to which you are going,
and when they die you can pluck out the plumes and bring them to me. Have no fear
of the enemies. Would you know who they are that the Eagles go to fight? They are
only the bumblebees and the tumble-weeds.&#x201d;<a href="#not256" class="noteref">256</a> She gave him a long black cane and said: &#x201c;With this you can gather the tumble-weeds
into a pile, and then you can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>set them on fire. Spit the juice of t<i>s</i>&#x12d;l<i>d</i>&#x12d;lg&#x12d;&#x2032;si<a href="#not257" class="noteref">257</a> at the bees and they cannot sting you. But before you burn up the tumble-weeds gather
some of the seeds, and when you have killed the bees take some of their nests. You
will need these things when you return to the earth.&#x201d; When Spider Woman had done speaking
the Navaho left to pursue his journey.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">582.</span> He travelled on, and soon came up with the warriors where they were hiding behind
a little hill and preparing for battle. Some were putting on their plumes; others
were painting and adorning themselves. From time to time one of their number would
creep cautiously to the top of the hill and peep over; then he would run back and
whisper: &#x201c;There are the enemies. They await us.&#x201d; The Navaho went to the top of the
hill and peered over; but he could see no enemy whatever. He saw only a dry, sandy
flat, covered in one place with sunflowers, and in another place with dead weeds;
for it was now late in the autumn in the world above.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">583.</span> Soon the Eagles were all ready for the fray. They raised their war-cry, and charged
over the hill into the sandy plain. The Navaho remained behind the hill, peeping over
to see what would occur. As the warriors approached the plain a whirlwind arose;<a href="#not258" class="noteref">258</a> a great number of tumble-weeds ascended with the wind and surged around madly through
the air; and, at the same time, from among the sunflowers a cloud of bumblebees arose.
The Eagles charged through the ranks of their enemies, and when they had passed to
the other side they turned around and charged back again. Some spread their wings
and soared aloft to attack the tumble-weeds that had gone up with the whirlwind. From
time to time the Navaho noticed the dark body of an Eagle falling down through the
air. When the combat had continued some time, the Navaho noticed a few of the Eagles
running toward the hill where he lay watching. In a moment some more came running
toward him, and soon after the whole party of Eagles, all that was left of it, rushed
past him, in a disorderly retreat, in the direction whence they had come, leaving
many slain on the field. Then the wind fell; the tumble-weeds lay quiet again on the
sand, and the bumblebees disappeared among the sunflowers.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">584.</span> When all was quiet, the Navaho walked down to the sandy flat, and, having gathered
some of the seeds and tied them up in a corner of his shirt, he collected the tumble-weeds
into a pile, using his black wand. Then he took out his fire-drill, started a flame,
and burnt up the whole pile. He gathered some t<i>s</i>&#x12d;l<i>d</i>&#x12d;lg&#x12d;&#x2032;si, as the Spider Woman had told him, chewed it, and went in among the sunflowers.
Here the bees gathered around him in a great swarm, and sought to sting him; but he
spat the juice of the t<i>s</i>&#x12d;l<i>d</i>&#x12d;lg&#x12d;&#x2032;si at them and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>stunned with it all that he struck. Soon the most of them lay helpless on the ground,
and the others fled in fear. He went around with his black wand and killed all that
he could find. He dug into the ground and got out some of their nests and honey; he
took a couple of the young bees and tied their feet together, and all these things
he put into the corner of his blanket. When the bees were conquered he did not forget
the wishes of his friend, the Spider Woman; he went around among the dead eagles,
and plucked as many plumes as he could grasp in both hands.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">585.</span> He set out on his return journey, and soon got back to the house of Spider Woman.
He gave her the plumes and she said: &#x201c;Thank you, my grandchild, you have brought me
the plumes that I have long wanted to adorn my walls, and you have done a great service
to your friends, the Eagles, because you have slain their enemies.&#x201d; When she had spoken
he set out again on his journey.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">586.</span> He slept that night on the trail, and next morning he got back to the towns of the
Eagles. As he approached he heard from afar the cries of the mourners, and when he
entered the place the people gathered around him and said: &#x201c;We have lost many of our
kinsmen, and we are wailing for them; but we have been also mourning for you, for
those who returned told us you had been killed in the fight.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">587.</span> He made no reply, but took from his blanket the two young bumblebees and swung them
around his head. All the people were terrified and ran, and they did not stop running
till they got safely behind their houses. In a little while they got over their fear,
came slowly from behind their houses, and crowded around the Navaho again. A second
time he swung the bees around his head, and a second time the people ran away in terror;
but this time they only went as far as the front walls of their houses, and soon they
returned again to the Navaho. The third time that he swung the bees around his head
they were still less frightened, ran but half way to their houses, and returned very
soon. The fourth time that he swung the bees they only stepped back a step or two.
When their courage came back to them, he laid the two bees on the ground; he took
out the seeds of the tumble-weeds and laid them on the ground beside the bees, and
then he said to the Eagle People: &#x201c;My friends, here are the children of your enemies;
when you see these you may know that I have slain your enemies.&#x201d; There was great rejoicing
among the people when they heard this, and this one said: &#x201c;It is well. They have slain
my brother,&#x201d; and that one said: &#x201c;It is well. They have slain my father,&#x201d; and another
said: &#x201c;It is well. They have slain my sons.&#x201d; Then Great Wolf, chief of the white pueblo,
said: &#x201c;I have two beautiful maiden daughters whom I shall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>give to you.&#x201d; Then Fox, chief of the blue pueblo in the south, promised him two more
maidens, and the chiefs of the other pueblos promised him two each, so that eight
beautiful maidens were promised to him in marriage.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">588.</span> The chief of the white pueblo now conducted the Navaho to his house and into a large
and beautiful apartment, the finest the poor Indian had ever seen. It had a smooth
wall, nicely coated with white earth, a large fireplace, mealing-stones, beautiful
pots and water-jars, and all the conveniences and furniture of a beautiful pueblo
home. And the chief said to him: &#x201c;<i>S</i>a<i>d</i>áni, my son-in-law, this house is yours.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">589.</span> The principal men from all the pueblos now came to visit him, and thanked him for
the great service he had done for them. Then his maidens from the yellow house came
in bringing corn meal; the maidens from the black house entered bringing soap-weed,
and the maidens of the white house, where he was staying, came bearing a large bowl
of white shell. A suds of the soap-weed was prepared in the shell bowl. The maidens
of the white house washed his head with the suds; the maidens of the black house washed
his limbs and feet, and those of the yellow house dried him with corn meal. When the
bath was finished the maidens went out; but they returned at dark, accompanied this
time by the maidens of the blue house. Each of the eight maidens carried a large bowl
of food, and each bowl contained food of a different kind. They laid the eight bowls
down before the Navaho, and he ate of all till he was satisfied. Then they brought
in beautiful robes and blankets, and spread them on the floor for his bed.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">590.</span> Next morning the Navaho went over to the sky-hole, taking with him the young bees
and the seeds of the tumble-weeds. To the former he said: &#x201c;Go down to the land of
the Navahoes and multiply there. My people will make use of you in the days to come;
but if you ever cause them sorrow and trouble, as you have caused the people of this
land, I shall again destroy you.&#x201d; As he spoke, he flung them down to the earth. Then
taking the seeds of the tumble-weeds in his hands, he spoke to them as he had spoken
to the bees, and threw them down through the sky-hole. The honey of the bees and the
seeds of the tumble-weeds are now used in the rites of yói <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or the bead chant.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">591.</span> The Navaho remained in the pueblos of the Eagle People twenty-four days, during which
time he was taught the songs, prayers, ceremonies, and sacrifices of the Eagles, the
same as those now known to us in the rite of yói <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>;<a href="#not259" class="noteref">259</a> and when he had learned all, the people told him it was time for him to return to
the earth, whence he had come.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">592.</span> They put on him a robe of eagle plumage, such as they wore themselves, and led him
to the sky-hole. They said to him: &#x201c;When you came up from the lower world you were
heavy and had to be carried by others. Henceforth you will be light and can move through
the air with your own power.&#x201d; He spread his wings to show that he was ready; the Eagles
blew a powerful breath behind him; he went down through the sky-hole, and was wafted
down on his outstretched wings until he lit on the summit of Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">593.</span> He went back to his own relations among the Navahoes; but when he went back everything
about their lodge smelt ill; its odors were intolerable to him, and he left it and
sat outside.<a href="#not260" class="noteref">260</a> They built for him then a medicine-lodge where he might sit by himself. They bathed
his younger brother, clothed him in new raiment, and sent him, too, into the lodge,
to learn what his elder brother could tell him. The brothers spent twelve days in
the lodge together, during which the elder brother told his story and instructed the
younger in all the rites and songs learned among the Eagles.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">594.</span> After this he went to visit the pueblo of K&#x12d;ntyél, whose inmates had before contemplated
such treachery to him; but they did not recognize him. He now looked sleek and well
fed. He was beautifully dressed and comely in his person, for the Eagles had moulded,
in beauty, his face and form. The pueblo people never thought that this was the poor
beggar whom they had left to die in the eagles&#x2019; nest. He noticed that there were many
sore and lame in the pueblo. A new disease, they told him, had broken out among them.
This was the disease which they had caught from the feathers of the eaglets when they
were attacking the nest. &#x201c;I have a brother,&#x201d; said the Navaho, &#x201c;who is a potent shaman.
He knows a rite that will cure this disease.&#x201d; The people of the pueblo consulted together
and concluded to employ his brother to perform the ceremony over their suffering ones.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">595.</span> The Navaho said that he must be one of the atsá&#x2bb;<i>l</i>ei,<a href="#not261" class="noteref">261</a> or first dancers, and that in order to perform the rite properly he must be dressed
in a very particular way. He must, he said, have strings of fine beads&#x2014;shell and turquoise&#x2014;sufficient
to cover his legs and forearms completely, enough to go around his neck, so that he
could not bend his head back, and great strings to pass over the shoulder and under
the arm on each side. He must have the largest shell basin to be found in either pueblo
to hang on his back, and the one next in size to hang on his chest. He must have their
longest and best strings of turquoise to hang to his ears. The Wind told him that
the greatest shell basin they had was so large that if he tried to embrace it around
the edge, his finger-tips would scarcely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>meet on the opposite side, and that this shell he must insist on having. The next
largest shell, Wind told him, was but little smaller.<a href="#not262" class="noteref">262</a>
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">596.</span> Three days after this conference, people began to come in from different pueblos
in the Chaco Canyon and from pueblos on the banks of the San Juan,&#x2014;all these pueblos
are now in ruins,&#x2014;and soon a great multitude had assembled. Meantime, too, they collected
shells and beads from the various pueblos in order to dress the atsá&#x2bb;<i>l</i>ei as he desired. They brought him some great shell basins and told him these were
what he wanted for the dance; but he measured them with his arms as Wind had told
him, and, finding that his hands joined easily when he embraced the shells, he discarded
them. They brought him larger and larger shells, and tried to persuade him that such
were their largest; but he tried and rejected all. On the last day, with reluctance,
they brought him the great shell of K&#x12d;ntyél and the great shell of K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;z. He clasped the first in his arms; his fingers did not meet on the opposite side.
He clasped the second in his arms, and the tips of his fingers just met. &#x201c;These,&#x201d;
said he, &#x201c;are the shells I must wear when I dance.&#x201d;

</p>
<p id="par597"><span class="parNum">597.</span> Four days before that on which the last dance was to occur, the pueblo people sent
out messengers to the neighboring camps of Navahoes, to invite the latter to witness
the exhibition of the last night and to participate in it with some of their alíli
(dances or dramas). One of the messengers went to the Chelly Canyon and there he got
Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i, with his son and daughter, to come and perform a dance. The other messengers started
for the Navaho camp at the foot of Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> on the south (near where Cobero is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>now). On his way he met an akán&#x12d;n&#x12d;li, or messenger, coming from Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i> to invite the people of the Chaco Canyon to a great Navaho ceremony. (You have heard
all about the meeting of these messengers in the legend of the mountain chant. I shall
not now repeat it.)<a href="#not263" class="noteref">263</a> The messengers exchanged bows and quivers as a sign they had met one another, and
the messenger from K&#x12d;ntyél returned to his people without being able to get the Navahoes
to attend. This is the reason that, on the last night of the great ceremony of yói
<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, there are but few different dances or shows.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">598.</span> On the evening of the last day they built a great circle of branches, such as the
Navahoes build now for the rites of the mountain chant (<a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a>), and a great number of people crowded into the <span class="corr" id="xd29e11178" title="Source: inclosure">enclosure</span>. They lighted the fires and dressed the atsá&#x2bb;<i>l</i>ei in all their fine beads and shells just as he desired them to dress him. They put
the great shell of K&#x12d;ntyél on his back, and the great shell of K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;<i>z</i> on his chest, and another fine shell on his forehead. Then the Navaho began to dance,
and his brother, the medicine-man, began to sing, and this was the song he sang:&#x2014;

<p class="first"><span class="parNum">599.</span> This seemed a strange song to the pueblo people, and they all wondered what it could
mean; but they soon found out what it meant, for they observed that the dancing Navaho
was slowly rising from the ground. First his head and then his shoulders appeared
above the heads of the crowd; next his chest and waist; but it was not until his whole
body had risen above the level of their heads that they began to realize the loss
that threatened them. He was rising toward the sky with the great shell of K&#x12d;ntyél,
and all the wealth of many pueblos in shell-beads and turquoise on his body. Then
they screamed wildly to him and called him by all sorts of dear names&#x2014;father, brother,
son&#x2014;to come down again, but the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>more they called the higher he rose. When his feet had risen above them they observed
that a streak of white lightning passed under his feet like a rope, and hung from
a dark cloud that gathered above. It was the gods that were lifting him; for thus,
the legends say, the gods lift mortals to the sky. When the pueblos found that no
persuasions could induce the Navaho to return, some called for ropes that they might
seize him and pull him down; but he was soon beyond the reach of their longest rope.
Then a shout was raised for arrows that they might shoot him; but before the arrows
could come he was lost to sight in the black cloud and was never more seen on earth.

<p id="not1"><span class="parNum">1.</span> How and when the name Navajo (pronounced N&#x103;&#x2032;v&#x103;-ho) originated has not been discovered.
It is only known that this name was given by the Spaniards while they still claimed
the Navaho land. The name is generally supposed to be derived from navaja, which means
a clasp-knife, or razor, and to have been applied because the Navaho warriors carried
great stone knives in former days. It has been suggested that the name comes from
navájo, a pool or small lake. The Navahoes call themselves <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; or <i>D</i>&#x12d;né, which means simply, men, people. This word in the various forms, Dénè, Tinnéh,
Tunné, etc., is used as a tribal designation for many branches of the Athapascan stock.
</p>
<p id="not2"><span class="parNum">2.</span> The Carrizo Mountains consist of an isolated mountain mass, about 12 miles in its
greatest diameter, situated in the northeast corner of Arizona. It is called by the
Navahoes Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náods&#x12d;<i>l</i>, which means mountain surrounded by mountains; such is the appearance of the landscape
viewed from the highest point, Pastora Peak, 9,420 feet high.
</p>
<p id="not3"><span class="parNum">3.</span> The San Juan River, a branch of the Colorado of the West, flows in a westerly direction
through the northern portion of the Navaho Reservation, and forms in part its northern
boundary. It is the most important river in the Navaho country. It has two names in
the Navaho language: one is Sá<i>n</i>b&#x12d;<i>t</i>o&#x2bb; (Water of Old Age, or Old Age River), said to be given because the stream is white
with foam and looks like the hair of an old man; the other is <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;baká (Male Water), given because it is turbulent and strong in contrast to the placid
Rio Grande, which the Navahoes call <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;baád, or Female Water. (See note <a href="#not137">137</a>.) Perhaps the river has other names.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">4.</span> <i>T</i>u-&#x12d;n-t<i>s</i>á is derived from <i>t</i>o&#x2bb; or <i>t</i>u (water) and &#x12d;nt<i>s</i>á or &#x12d;ntsá (abundant, scattered widely). The name is spelled Tuincha, Tuintcha, and
Tunicha on our maps. The Tuincha Mountains are situated partly in New Mexico and partly
in Arizona, about 30 miles from the northern boundary of both Territories. They form
the middle portion of a range of which the Chusca and Lukachokai Mountains form the
rest. The portion known as <i>T</i>u&#x12d;nt<i>s</i>á is about 12 miles long. The highest point is 9,575 feet above sea-level. The top
of the range, which is rather level and plateau-like, is well covered with timber,
mostly spruce and pine, and abounds in small lakes and ponds; hence the name <i>T</i>u&#x12d;nt<i>s</i>á.
</p>
<p id="not5"><span class="parNum">5.</span> The basket illustrated in <a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a> is made of twigs of aromatic sumac (<i lang="la">Rhus aromatica</i>, var. <i lang="la">trilobata</i>). It is 13&#x2032; in diameter and 3&#x2013;&#x215c;&#x2032; deep. In forming the helical coil, the fabricator
must always put the butt end of the twig toward the centre of the basket and the tip
end toward the periphery, in accordance with the ceremonial laws governing the disposition
of butts and tips (see notes <a href="#not12">12</a> and <a href="#not319">319</a>). The sole decoration is a band, red in the middle with black zigzag edges. This
band is intersected at one point by a narrow line of uncolored wood. This line has
probably no relation to the &#x201c;line of life&#x201d; in ancient and modern pueblo pottery. It
is put there to assist in the orientation of the basket at night, in the dim light
of the medicine-lodge. In making the basket, the butt of the first twig is placed
in the centre; the tip of the last twig, in the helix, must be in the same radial
line, which is marked by the uncolored line crossing the ornamental band. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>This line must lie due east and west on certain ceremonial occasions, as for instance
when the basket, inverted, is used as a drum during the last five nights of the night
chant. The margin of this, as of other Navaho baskets, is finished in a diagonally
woven or plaited pattern, and there is a legend, which the author has related in a
former paper,<a href="#not321" class="noteref">321</a> accounting for the origin of this form of margin. If the margin is worn through or
torn, the basket is unfit for sacred use. The basket is one of the perquisites of
the shaman when the rites are done; but he, in turn, must give it away, and must be
careful never to eat out of it. Notwithstanding its sacred uses, food may be served
in it. <a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a> represents a basket of this kind used as a receptacle for sacrificial sticks and
cigarettes. In this case the termination of the helix must be in the east, and the
sacrifices sacred to the east must be in the eastern quarter of the basket.
</p>
<p><a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a> shows the other form of sacred basket. It is also made of aromatic sumac, and is
used in the rites to hold sacred meal. The crosses are said to represent clouds, and
the zigzag lines to indicate lightning.
</p>
<p id="not6"><span class="parNum">6.</span> The ceremonies of &#x201c;House Dedication&#x201d; are described at some length by Mr. A.&nbsp;M. Stephen
in his excellent paper on &#x201c;The Navajo,&#x201d;<a href="#not329" class="noteref">329</a> and he gives a free translation of a prayer and a song belonging to these rites.
</p>
<p id="not7"><span class="parNum">7.</span> A-na-yé, or a-ná-ye, is composed of two words, aná and yéi or ye. Aná, sometimes
contracted to na, signifies a member of an alien tribe,&#x2014;one not speaking a language
similar to the Navaho,&#x2014;and is often synonymous with enemy. Ye (see <a href="#par78">par. 78</a>) may be defined as genius or god. The anáye were the offspring of women conceived
during the separation of the sexes in the fourth world.
</p>
<p id="not8"><span class="parNum">8.</span> Ti-é-hol-tso-di is a water god, or water monster, a god of terrestrial waters,&#x2014;not
a rain god. He seems akin to the Unktehi of the Dakotas. He is said to dwell in the
great water of the east, <i>i.e.</i>, the Atlantic Ocean. Although commonly spoken of as one, there is little doubt that
the Navahoes believe in many of the Tiéholtsodi. Probably every constant stream or
spring has its own water god, (See note <a href="#not152">152</a>.) A picture of this god is said to be made in a dry-painting of the rite of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, but the author has not seen it. Tiéholtsodi is described as having a fine fur, and
being otherwise much like an otter in appearance, but having horns like a buffalo.
(See <a href="#par140">pars. 140</a>, <a href="#par187">187</a>, <a href="#par484">484</a>, <a href="#par485">485</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not9"><span class="parNum">9.</span> T<i>s</i>ú<i>s</i>-kai or T<i>s</i>ó-i<i>s</i>-kai is the name given by the Navahoes to a prominent conical hill rising 8,800 feet
above sea-level, in northwestern New Mexico, about twenty-six miles north of Defiance
Station on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. It is called Chusca Knoll, Chusca Peak,
and Choiskai Peak by geographers. It rises abruptly four hundred feet or more above
the level of the neighboring ridge<span class="corr" id="xd29e11369" title="Source: .">,</span> is visible at a great distance from the south (but not from the north), and forms
a prominent landmark. The Navahoes limit the name T<i>s</i>ú<i>s</i>kai to this knoll, but the Mexicans, and following them the Americans, apply the name
in different forms (Chusca Mountains, Sierra de Chusca, Chuska, Chuskai, Tchuskai,
etc.) to the whole mountain mass from which the knoll rises. The name, not accurately

<p id="not10"><span class="parNum">10.</span> The bath forms an important part of the Navaho rites, being administered on many
occasions, and it is often mentioned in the tales. It usually consists of a suds made
in a water-tight wicker basket by soaking the root of some species of yucca (see note
<a href="#not88">88</a>) in water; the root of <i lang="la">Yucca baccata</i> being usually preferred, as it seems richest in saponine. After the application of
the suds, the subject is <span class="corr" id="xd29e11389" title="Source: commmonly">commonly</span> rinsed off with plain water and dried by rubbing on corn meal. In different ceremonies
different observances are connected with the bath. In the myth of &#x201c;The Mountain Chant,&#x201d;<a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a> pp. 389, 390, a bath is described as part of the ceremony of the deer-hunt. It is
given, no doubt, in preparing for the hunt, for practical as well as religious reasons.
It is important that the hunter should divest himself as much as possible of his personal
odor when he goes to kill game.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p id="not11"><span class="parNum">11.</span> Pollen (Navaho, <i>t</i><i>h</i>a<i>d</i>i<i>t</i>í<i>n</i>) is obtained, for sacred uses, from various plants, but Indian corn is the chief
source of supply. The pollen is carried in small buckskin bags, which also usually
contain small sacred stones, such as rock crystal and pyrophyllite, or small animal
<span class="corr" id="xd29e11410" title="Source: fetiches">fetishes</span>. The administration or sacrifice of pollen is a part of all rites witnessed, and
almost always follows or accompanies prayer. It is used in different ways on different
occasions; but the commonest way is to take a small pinch from the bag, apply a portion
of it to the tongue and a portion to the crown of the head. For some purposes, the
shaman collects a quantity of pollen, puts it in a large bag, immerses in it some
live bird, insect, or other animal, and then allows the prisoner to escape. This is
supposed to add extra virtue to the pollen. In one kind called i&#x2bb;yi<i>d</i>&#x115;zná a bluebird, a yellowbird, and a grasshopper are put in the pollen together. In
note <a href="#not49">49</a> we have a mythic account of pollen put on the young of the sea monster and then preserved.
Pollen which has been applied to a ceremonial dry-painting is preserved for future
uses. Pollen in which a live striped lizard has been placed is used to favor eutocia.
The term <i>t</i><i>h</i>a<i>d</i>i<i>t</i>í<i>n</i> is applied to various things having the appearance of an impalpable powder, such
as the misty hues of the horizon in the morning and evening, due in Arizona more frequently
to dust in the air than to moisture. Captain Bourke, in &#x201c;The Medicine-men of the Apache,&#x201d;<a href="#not295" class="noteref">295</a> chapter ii., describes many modes of using pollen which exist also among the Navahoes.
</p>
<p id="not12"><span class="parNum">12.</span> The following are a few additional observances with regard to kethawns:&#x2014;
</p>
<p>In cutting the reed used for a series of cigarettes, they cut off a piece first from
the end nearest the root, and they continue to cut off as many pieces as may be necessary
from butt to point. The pieces, according as they are cut, are notched near the butt
(with a stone knife), so that the relations of the two extremities of the piece may
not be forgotten. All through the painting of the cigarettes, and the various manipulations
that follow, the butt end must be the nearer to the operator, and the tip end the
farther away from him. Since the cigarette-maker sits in the west of the medicine-lodge
facing the east, the cigarettes, while there, must lie east and west, with the tips
to the east. If a number of cigarettes are made for one act of sacrifice, the first
piece cut off is marked with one notch near the base, the second piece with two notches,
the third piece with three notches, the fourth piece with four notches, all near the
butt ends. This is done in order that they may always be distinguished from one another,
and their order of precedence from butt to tip may not be disregarded. When they are
taken up to be painted, to have the sacred feathers of the bluebird and yellowbird
inserted into them, to be filled with tobacco, to be sealed with moistened pollen,
or to be symbolically lighted with the rock crystal, the piece that came from nearest
the butt (the senior cigarette, let us call it) is taken first, that nearest the tip
last. When they are collected to be placed in the patient&#x2019;s hands, when they are applied
to his or her person, and finally when they are taken out and sacrificed, this order
of precedence is always observed. The order of precedence in position, when sacrifices
are laid out in a straight row, is from north to south; the senior sacrifice is in
the northern extremity of the row, the junior or inferior in the southern extremity.
When they are laid out in a circle, the order is from east back to east by the way
of the south, west, and north. The gods to whom the sacrifices are made have commonly
also an order of precedence, and when such is the case the senior sacrifice is dedicated
to the higher god, the junior sacrifice to the lower god. When it is required that
other articles, such as feathers, beads, powdered vegetable and mineral substances,
be sacrificed with the cigarettes, all these things are placed in corn-husks. To do
this, the husks are laid down on a clean cloth with their tips to the east; the cigarettes
are laid in them one by one, each in a separate husk, with their tip ends to the east;
and the sacred feathers are added to the bundle with their tips also to the east.
When dry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>pollen is sprinkled on the cigarette, it is sprinkled from butt to tip. When moist
pollen is daubed on the side of the cigarette, it is daubed from butt to tip. (From
&#x201c;A Study in Butts and Tips.&#x201d;)<a href="#not319" class="noteref">319</a> The hollow internode of the reed only is used. The part containing the solid node
is discarded and is split up, so that when thrown away the gods may not mistake it
for a true cigarette and suffer disappointment. All the débris of manufacture is carefully
collected and deposited to the north of the medicine-lodge. The tobacco of commerce
must not be employed. A plug of feathers, referred to above, is shoved into the tube
from tip to butt (with an owl&#x2019;s feather) to keep the tobacco from falling out at the
butt. The moistened pollen keeps the tobacco in at the tip end. The rules for measuring
kethawns are very elaborate. One or more finger-joints; the span; the width of the
outstretched hand, from tip of thumb to tip of little finger; the width of three finger-tips
or of four finger-tips joined,&#x2014;are a few of the measurements. Each kethawn has its
established size. This system of sacrifice is common among the pueblo tribes of the
Southwest, and traces of it have been found elsewhere. <a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a> represents a thing called ke<i>t</i>án yal<i>t</i>í, or talking kethawn (described in &#x201c;The Mountain Chant,&#x201d;<a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a> p. 452), consisting of a male stick painted black and a female stick painted blue.
<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a> shows a kethawn used in the ceremony of the night chant; a dozen such are made for
one occasion, but male and female are not distinguished. <a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a> depicts a set of fifty-two kethawns, used also in the night chant: of these the four
in the centre are cigarettes lying on meal; the forty-eight surrounding the meal are
sticks of wood. Those in the east are made of mountain mahogany, those in the south
of <i lang="la">Forestiera neo-mexicana</i>, those in the west of juniper, and those in the north of cherry. A more elaborate
description of them must be reserved for a future work.
</p>
<p id="not13"><span class="parNum">13.</span> &#x201c;Sacred buckskin&#x201d; is a term employed by the author, for convenience, to designate
those deerskins specially prepared for use in making masks and for other purposes
in the Navaho rites. The following are some of the particulars concerning their preparation;
perhaps there are others which the author has not learned: The deer which is to furnish
the skin must not be shot, or otherwise wounded. It is surrounded by men on foot or
horseback, and caused to run around until it falls exhausted; then a bag containing
pollen is put over its mouth and nostrils, and held there till the deer is smothered.
The dead animal is laid on its back. Lines are marked with pollen, from the centre
outwards along the median line of the body and the insides of the limbs. Incisions
are made with a stone knife along the pollen lines, from within outwards, until the
skin is opened; the flaying may then be completed with a steel knife. When the skin
is removed it is laid to the east of the carcass, head to the east, and hairy side
down. The fibulæ and ulnæ are cut out and put in the skin in the places where they
belong,&#x2014;<i>i.e.</i>, each ulna in the skin of its appropriate fore-leg, each fibula in the skin of its
appropriate hind-leg. The hide may then be rolled up and carried off. Both ulnæ are
used as scrapers of the skin. If masks are to be made of the skin, the fibulæ are
used as awls,&#x2014;the right fibula in sewing the right sides of the masks, the left fibula
in sewing the left sides of the masks. Other rules (very numerous) for making the
masks will not be mentioned in this place. Fibulæ and ulnæ other than those belonging
to the deer that furnished the skin must not be used on the latter.
</p>
<p id="not14"><span class="parNum">14.</span> This mask, made of leaves of <i lang="la">Yucca baccata</i>, from which the thick dorsal portions have been torn away, is used in the rite of
the night chant. The observances connected with the culling of the leaves, the manufacture
of the mask, and the destruction of the same after use, are too numerous to be detailed
here. The author never succeeded in getting such a mask to keep (the obligation on
the shaman to tear it up when it has served its purpose seemed imperative), but he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>was allowed to take two photographs of it, one before the fringe of spruce twigs was
applied, the other when the mask was finished, as shown in <a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>.
</p>
<p id="not15"><span class="parNum">15.</span> The following account taken from &#x201c;The Prayer of a Navajo Shaman,&#x201d;<a href="#not315" class="noteref">315</a> and repeated here at the request of Mr. Newell, shows how definitely fixed was the
limit of this part of the tale in the mind of the narrator:&#x2014;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;In none of my interviews with him (<i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i <span class="corr" id="xd29e11495" title="Source: N&#x11b;z">N&#x115;z</span>) had he shown any impatience with my demands for explanations as we progressed, or
with interruptions in our work. He lingered long over his meals, lighted many cigarettes
and smoked them leisurely, got tired early in the evening, and was always willing
to go to bed as early as I would let him. When, however, he came to relate the creation
myth, all this was changed. He arrived early; he remained late; he hastened through
his meals; he showed evidence of worry at all delays and interruptions, and frequently
begged me to postpone minor explanations. On being urged to explain this change of
spirit he said that we were travelling in the land of the dead, in a place of evil
and potent ghosts, just so long as he continued to relate those parts of the myth
which recount the adventures of his ancestors in the nether world, and that we were
in danger so long as our minds remained there; but that when we came to that part
of the tale where the people ascend to this&#x2014;the fifth and last world&#x2014;we need no longer
feel uneasy and could then take our time. His subsequent actions proved that he had
given an honest explanation.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;It was near sunset one afternoon, and an hour or more before his supper time, that
he concluded his account of the subterranean wanderings of the Navajos and brought
them safely through the &#x201c;Place of Emergence,&#x201d; in the San Juan Mountains, to the surface
of this world. Then he ceased to speak, rolled a cigarette, said he was tired, that
he would not be able to tell me any more that night, and left me.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;After his departure I learned that he had announced to some of his friends during
the day that he would have to pray at night to counteract the evil effects of his
journey through the lower world. After his supper he retired to the apartment among
the old adobe huts at Defiance in which he had been assigned room to sleep. I soon
followed, and, having waited in the adjoining passage half an hour or more, I heard
the voice of the old man rising in the monotonous tones of formulated prayer. Knowing
that the rules of the shaman forbade the interruption of any prayer or song, I abruptly
entered the room and sat down on the floor near the supplicant.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>(Thus the prayer in question became known to the author.)
</p>
<p id="not15a"><span class="parNum">15<i>a</i>.</span> &#x201c;Tune us the sitar neither low nor high.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Light of Asia.</i>
</p>
<p id="not16"><span class="parNum">16.</span> <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, in Navaho, means a sacred song, a hymn or chant,&#x2014;not a trivial song: hence the names
of their great ceremonies contain this word, as ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>y&#x12d;&#x2032;d<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> (the mountain chant); kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> (the night chant), etc. The man who conducts a ceremony is called <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i (chanter or singer). As equivalents for this word the author uses the terms shaman,
priest, medicine-man, and chanter. One who treats disease by drugs is called azé-el&#x12d;&#x2032;ni,
or medicine-maker.

</p>
<p id="not18"><span class="parNum">18.</span> In symbolizing by color the four cardinal points, the Navahoes have two principal
systems, as follows:&#x2014;
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="table">

<td class="cellLeft cellTop"> </td>

</tr>
</table>
</div><p>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>Both systems are the same, except that the colors black and white change places. The
reasons for this change have not been satisfactorily determined. In general, it seems
that when speaking of places over ground&#x2014;lucky and happy places&#x2014;the first system is
employed; while, when places underground&#x2014;usually places of danger&#x2014;are described, the
second system is used. But there are many apparent exceptions to the latter rule.
In one version of the Origin Legend (Version B) the colors are arranged according
to the second system both in the lower and upper worlds. In the version of the same
legend here published the first system is given for all places in the lower worlds,
except in the house of Tiéholtsodi under the waters (<a href="#par178">par. 178</a>), where the east room is described as dark and the room in the north as being of
all colors. Yet the Indian who gave this version (<i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i <span class="corr" id="xd29e11605" title="Source: N&#x11b;z">N&#x115;z</span>), in his Prayer of the Rendition (note <a href="#not315">315</a>), applies the second system to all regions traversed below the surface of the earth
by the gods who come to rescue the lost soul. Although he does not say that the black
chamber is in the east, he shows it corresponds with the east by mentioning it first.
<i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i Natlói, in the &#x201c;Story of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani,&#x201d; follows the first system in all cases except when describing the house of Tiéholtsodi
under the water, where the first chamber is represented as black and the last as white.
Although in this case the rooms may be regarded as placed one above another, the black
being mentioned first shows that it is intended to correspond with the east. In all
cases, in naming the points of the compass, or anything which symbolizes them, or
in placing objects which pertain to them (note <a href="#not227">227</a>), the east comes first, the south second, the west third, the north fourth. The sunwise
circuit is always followed. If the zenith and nadir are mentioned, the former comes
fifth and the latter sixth in order. The north is sometimes symbolized by &#x201c;all colors,&#x201d;
<i>i.e.</i>, white, blue, yellow, and black mixed (note <a href="#not22">22</a>), and sometimes by red. In the myth of ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>y&#x12d;&#x2032;d<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i><a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a> (the story of Ds&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>yi&#x2bb; Neyáni) five homes of holy people underground are described, in all of which the
second system is used. See, also, note <a href="#not111">111</a>, where the second system is applied to the house of the sun. In the story of the
&#x201c;Great Shell of K&#x12d;ntyél&#x201d; at the home of the Spider Woman underground, in the sky world,
the east is represented by black and the north by white. (See <a href="#par581">par. 581</a> and note <a href="#not40">40</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not19"><span class="parNum">19.</span> There are but three streams and but nine villages or localities mentioned, while
twelve winged tribes are named. Probably three are supposed to have lived in the north
where no stream ran, or there may have been a fourth river in the Navaho paradise,
whose name is for some reason suppressed.
</p>
<p>References to the sacred number four are introduced with tiresome pertinacity into
all Navaho legends.
</p>
<p id="not20"><span class="parNum">20.</span> Version B.&#x2014;In the first world three dwelt, viz.: First Man, First Woman, and Coyote.
</p>
<p id="not21"><span class="parNum">21.</span> The swallow to which reference is made here is the cliff swallow,&#x2014;<i lang="la">Petrochelidon lunifrons</i>.
</p>
<p id="not22"><span class="parNum">22.</span> The colors given to the lower worlds in this legend&#x2014;red for the first, blue for the
second, yellow for the third, and mixed for the fourth&#x2014;are not in the line of ordinary
Navaho symbolism (note <a href="#not18">18</a>), but they agree very closely with some Moki symbolism, as described by Victor Mindeleff
in his &#x201c;Study of Pueblo Architecture,&#x201d;<a href="#not324" class="noteref">324</a> p. 129. The colors there mentioned, if placed in order according to the Navaho system
(note <a href="#not18">18</a>), would stand thus: red (east), blue (south), yellow (west), white (north). Mixed
colors sometimes take the place of the north or last in Navaho symbolism. Possibly
Moki elements have entered into this version of the Navaho legend. (See <a href="#par91">par. 91</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not23"><span class="parNum">23.</span> Version B.&#x2014;In the second world, when First Man, First Woman, and Coyote ascended,
they found those who afterwards carried the sun and moon, and, beyond the bounds of
the earth, he of the darkness in the east, he of the blueness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>in the south, he of the yellowness in the west, and he of the whiteness in the north
(perhaps the same as White Body, Blue Body, etc., of the fourth world in the present
version. See <a href="#par160">par. 160</a>). Sun and First Woman were the transgressors who caused the exodus.
</p>
<p id="not24"><span class="parNum">24.</span> Version B.&#x2014;When the five individuals mentioned in note <a href="#not23">23</a> came from the second world, they found the &#x201c;people of the mountains&#x201d; already occupying
the third world.
</p>
<p id="not25"><span class="parNum">25.</span> Version B.&#x2014;The people were chased from the third world to the fourth world by a deluge
and took refuge in a reed, as afterwards related of the flight from the fourth world.
</p>
<p id="not26"><span class="parNum">26.</span> In the Navaho tales, when the yéi (genii, gods) come to visit men, they always announce
their approach by calling four times. The first call is faint, far, and scarcely audible.
Each succeeding call is louder and more distinct. The last call sounds loud and near,
and in a moment after it is heard the god makes his appearance. These particulars
concerning the gods&#x2019; approach are occasionally briefly referred to; but usually the
story-teller repeats them at great length with a modulated voice, and he pantomimically
represents the recipient of the visit, starting and straining his attention to discern
the distant sounds.
</p>
<p>Nearly every god has his own special call. A few have none. Imperfect attempts have
been made in this work to represent some of these calls by spelling them; but this
method represents the original no better than &#x201c;Bob White&#x201d; represents the call of a
quail. Some of the cries have been recorded by the writer on phonographic cylinders,
but even these records are very imperfect. In the ceremonies of the Navahoes, the
masked representatives of the gods repeat these calls. The calls of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an are those most frequently referred to in the tales. (<a href="#par287">Pars. 287</a>, <a href="#par378">378</a>, <a href="#par471">471</a>, etc.)
</p>
<p id="not27"><span class="parNum">27.</span> Yellow corn belongs to the female, white corn to the male. This rule is observed
in all Navaho ceremonies, and is mentioned in many Navaho myths. (<a href="#par164">Pars. 164</a>, <a href="#par291">291</a>, <a href="#par379">379</a>; note <a href="#not107">107</a>, etc.)
</p>
<p id="not28"><span class="parNum">28.</span> An ear of corn used for sacred purposes must be completely covered with full grains,
or at least must have been originally so covered. One having abortive grains at the
top is not used. For some purposes, as in preparing the implements used in initiating
females in the rite of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, not only must the ear of corn be fully covered by grains, but it must be tipped
by an arrangement of four grains. Such an ear of corn is called <i>t</i>ohono<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni.
</p>
<p id="not29"><span class="parNum">29.</span> The Navaho word nátli or n&#x16d;&#x2032;tle is here translated hermaphrodite, because the context
shows that reference is made to anomalous creatures. But the word is usually employed
to designate that class of men, known perhaps in all wild Indian tribes, who dress
as women, and perform the duties usually allotted to women in Indian camps. Such persons
are called berdaches (English, bardash) by the French Canadians. By the Americans
they are called hermaphrodites (commonly mispronounced &#x201c;morphodites&#x201d;), and are generally
supposed to be such.
</p>
<p id="not30"><span class="parNum">30.</span> These so-called hermaphrodites (note <a href="#not29">29</a>) are, among all Indian tribes that the author has observed, more skilful in performing
women&#x2019;s work than the women themselves. The Navahoes, in this legend, credit them
with the invention of arts practised by women. The best weaver in the Navaho tribe,
for many years, was a nátli.
</p>
<p id="not31"><span class="parNum">31.</span> Masks made from the skins of deer-heads and antelope-heads, with or without antlers,
have been used by various Indian tribes, in hunting, to deceive the animals and allow
the hunters to approach them. There are several references to such masks in the Navaho
tales, as in the story of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani (<a href="#par544">par. 544</a>) and in the myth of &#x201c;The Mountain Chant,&#x201d; page 391.<a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a> In the latter story, rites connected with the deer mask are described.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p id="not32"><span class="parNum">32.</span> The quarrel between First Man and First Woman came to pass in this way: When she
had finished her meal she wiped her hands in her dress and said: &#x201c;E&#x2bb;yéhe <i>s</i>i-t<i>s</i>o<i>d</i>&#x201d; (Thanks, my vagina). &#x201c;What is that you say?&#x201d; asked First Man. &#x201c;E&#x2bb;éhe <i>s</i>i-t<i>s</i>o<i>d</i>,&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Why do you speak thus?&#x201d; he queried; &#x201c;Was it not I who killed the
deer whose flesh you have eaten? Why do you not thank me? Was it t<i>s</i>o<i>d</i> that killed the deer?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she replied; &#x201c;if it were not for that, you would not
have killed the deer. If it were not for that, you lazy men would do nothing. It is
that which does all the work.&#x201d; &#x201c;Then, perhaps, you women think you can live without
the men,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Certainly we can. It is we women who till the fields and gather
food: we can live on the produce of our fields, and the seeds and fruits we collect.
We have no need of you men.&#x201d; Thus they argued. First Man became more and more angry
with each reply that his wife made, until at length, in wrath, he jumped across the
fire.
</p>
<p id="not33"><span class="parNum">33.</span> During the separation of the sexes, both the men and the women were guilty of shameful
practices, which the story-tellers very particularly describe. Through the transgressions
of the women the anáye, alien gods or monsters, who afterwards nearly annihilated
the human race, came into existence; but no evil consequences followed the transgressions
of the men. Thus, as usual, a moral lesson is conveyed to the women, but none to the

the ceremony of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> a picture representing Tiéholtsodi and the four waters is said to be made.
</p>
<p id="not37"><span class="parNum">37.</span> Version A says that the nodes were woven by the spider, and that different animals
dwelt in the different internodes. Version B says that the great reed took more than
one day to grow to the sky; that it grew by day and rested by night; that the hollow
internodes now seen in the reed show where it grew by day, and the solid nodes show
where it rested by night. Some say four reeds were planted to form one, others that
one reed only was planted.
</p>
<p id="not38"><span class="parNum">38.</span> Version B.&#x2014;The Turkey was the last to take refuge in the reed, therefore he was at
the bottom. When the waters rose high enough to wet the Turkey he gobbled, and all
knew that danger was near. Often did the waves wash the end of his tail; and it is
for this reason that the tips of turkeys&#x2019; tail-feathers are, to this day, lighter
than the rest of the plumage.

<p id="not39"><span class="parNum">39.</span> Version A.&#x2014;First Man and First Woman called on all the digging animals (&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>at<i>s</i>idi <i>d</i>áltso) to help. These were: Bear, Wolf, Coyote, Lynx, and Badger. First, Bear dug
till he was tired; then Coyote took his place, and so on. When badger was digging,
water began to drip down from above: then they knew they had struck the waters of
the upper world, and sent Locust up. Locust made a sort of shaft in the soft mud,
such as locusts make to this day.
</p>
<p id="not40"><span class="parNum">40.</span> Version A says there were four cranes; Version B, that there were four swans. Both
versions say that the bird of the east was black, that of the south blue, that of
the west yellow, and that of the north white. (See note <a href="#not18">18</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not41"><span class="parNum">41.</span> Two versions, A and B, have it that the bird passed the arrows through from mouth
to vent, and <i>vice versa</i>, but all make the Locust pass his arrows through his thorax. Another version relates
that two of the birds said: &#x201c;You can have the land if you let us strike you in the
forehead with an axe.&#x201d; Locust consented. They missed their aim and cut off his cheeks,
which accounts for his narrow face now. Version A relates that the arrows were plumed
with eagle-feathers.
</p>
<p id="not42"><span class="parNum">42.</span> Version A.&#x2014;The Locust, before transfixing himself with the arrows, shoved his vitals
down into his abdomen; then he changed his mind and shoved them high into his chest.
That accounts for his big chest now.

<p id="not43"><span class="parNum">43.</span> A small lake situated somewhere in the San Juan Mountains is said to be the place
through which the people came from the fourth world to this world. It is surrounded,
the Indians tell, by precipitous cliffs, and has a small island near its centre, from
the top of which something rises that looks like the top of a ladder. Beyond the bounding
cliffs there are four mountain peaks,&#x2014;one to the east, one to the south, one to the
west, and one to the north of the lake,&#x2014;which are frequently referred to in the songs
and myths of the Navahoes. These Indians fear to visit the shores of this lake, but
they climb the surrounding mountains and view its waters from a distance. The place
is called <i>H</i>a-d<i>z</i>i-naí, or Ni-<i>h</i>o-yos-t<i>s</i>á-t<i>s</i>e, which names may be freely translated Place of Emergence, or Land Where They Came
Up. The San Juan Mountains abound in little lakes. Which one of these is considered
by the Navahoes as their Place of Emergence is not known, and it is probable that
it could only be determined by making a pilgrimage thither with a party of Navahoes
who knew the place. Mr. Whitman Cross, of the United States Geological Survey, who
has made extensive explorations in the San Juan Mountains, relates that Trout Lake
is regarded by the Indians as a sacred lake; that they will not camp near it, and
call it a name which is rendered Spirit Lake. This sheet of water is designated as
San Miguel Lake on the maps of Hayden&#x2019;s Survey. It lies near the line of the Rio Grande
Southern Railroad, at the head of the South Fork of San Miguel River. It has no island.
A small lake, which accords more in appearance with the Navahoes&#x2019; description of their
sacred lake, is Island Lake. This has a small, rocky island in the middle. It is situated
on a branch of the South Fork of Mineral Creek, three miles southeast of Ophir, Colorado,
at an altitude of 12,450 feet. Prof. A.&nbsp;H. Thompson has suggested that Silver Lake,
about five miles southeasterly from Silverton, Colorado, may be the Place of Emergence.
This lake is 11,600 feet above sea-level, and is surrounded by four high mountain
peaks, but it has no island.

Version B.&#x2014;He of the darkness of the east cut the cliffs with his knife shaped like
a horn.
</p>
<p id="not45"><span class="parNum">45.</span> Version A.&#x2014;They prayed to the four Winds,&#x2014;the black Wind of the east, the blue Wind
of the south, the yellow Wind of the west, and the white Wind of the north,&#x2014;and they
sang a wind-song which is still sung in the rite of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>. Version B.&#x2014;They prayed to the four Winds.

<p id="not46"><span class="parNum">46.</span> The Kisáni, being builders of stone houses, set up a stone wall; the others, representing

<p id="not47"><span class="parNum">47.</span> Ts&#x12d;-<i>d</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>, or ts&#x12d;n-<i>d</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i> is a game played by the Navaho women. The principal implements of the game are three
sticks, which are thrown violently, ends down, on a flat stone, around which the gamblers
sit. The sticks rebound so well that they would fly far away, were not a blanket stretched
overhead to throw them back to the players. A number of small stones, placed in the
form of a square, are used as counters; these are not moved, but sticks, whose positions
are changed according to the fortunes of the game, are placed between them. The rules
of the game have not been recorded. The other games were: <i>d</i>ilkó<i>n</i>, played with two sticks, each the length of an arm; atsá, played with forked sticks
and a ring; and a<i>s</i>p&#x12d;&#x2032;n.
</p>
<p id="not48"><span class="parNum">48.</span> Version A.&#x2014;Coyote and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni were partners in the theft of the young of Tiéholtsodi. When Coyote saw the water
rising, he pointed with his protruded lips (as Indians often do) to the water, and
glanced significantly at his accomplice. First Man observed the glance, had his suspicions
aroused, and began to search.
</p>
<p id="not49"><span class="parNum">49.</span> Other variants of the story of the restoration of Tiéholtsodi&#x2019;s young speak <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>of sacrifices and peace offerings in keeping with the Indian custom. Version A.&#x2014;They
got a haliotis shell of enormous size, so large that a man&#x2019;s encircling arm could
barely surround it. Into this they put other shells and many precious stones. They
sprinkled pollen on the young and took some of it off again, for it had been rendered
more holy by contact with the bodies of the young sea monsters. Then they put these
also into the shell and laid all on the horns of Tiéholtsodi; at once he disappeared
under the earth and the waters went down after him. The pollen taken from the young
was distributed among the people, and brought them rain and game and much good fortune.
Version B.&#x2014;&#x201c;At once they threw them (the young) down to their father, and with them
a sacrifice of the treasures of the sea,&#x2014;their shell ornaments. In an instant the
waters began to rush down through the hole and away from the lower worlds.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">50.</span> Some give the name of the hermaphrodite who died as Natliyil<i>h</i>át<i>s</i>e, and say that &#x201c;she&#x201d; is now the chief of devils in the lower world,&#x2014;perhaps the same
as the Woman Chief referred to in the &#x201c;Prayer of a Navaho Shaman.&#x201d; <a href="#not315" class="noteref">315</a> Version B says that the first to die was the wife of a great chief. (See note <a href="#not68">68</a>.)
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">51.</span> Version A describes the making of the sacred mountains thus: Soon after the arrival
of the people in the fifth world (after the first sudatory had been built and the
first corn planted), some one said: &#x201c;It would be well if we had in this world such
mountains as we had in the world below.&#x201d; &#x201c;I have brought them with me,&#x201d; said First
Man. He did not mean to say he had brought the whole of the mountains with him, but
only a little earth from each, with which to start new mountains here. The people
laid down four sacred buckskins<a href="#not18" class="noteref">18</a> and two sacred baskets<a href="#not5" class="noteref">5</a> for him to make his mountains on, for there were six sacred mountains in the lower
world, just as there are six in this, and they were named the same there as they now
are here. The mountain in the east, Ts&#x12d;snad<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni, he made of clay from the mountain of the east below, mixed with white shell.
The mountain of the south, Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i>, he made of earth from below mixed with turquoise. The mountain of the west he made
of earth mixed with haliotis or abalone shell. The mountain of the north he made of
earth mixed with cannel coal.<a href="#not158" class="noteref">158</a> Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i> he made of earth from the similar mountain in the lower world, mixed with goods of
all kinds (yú<i>d</i>i al<i>t</i><i>h</i>asaí). T<i>s</i>olíhi he made of earth from below, mixed with shells and precious stones of all kinds
(&#x12d;nkl&#x12d;&#x2032;z al<i>t</i><i>h</i>asaí). While they were still on the buckskins and baskets, ten songs were sung which
now belong to the rites of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>. The burdens of these songs are as follows:&#x2014;
</p>
<ul>
<li>1st. Long ago he thought of it.
</li>
<li>2d. Long ago he spoke of it.
</li>
<li>3d. A chief among mountains he brought up with him.
</li>
<li>4th. A chief among mountains he has made.
</li>
<li>5th. A chief among mountains is rising.
</li>
<li>6th. A chief among mountains is beginning to stand.
</li>
<li>7th. A chief among mountains stands up.
</li>
<li>8th. A cigarette for a chief among mountains we make.
</li>
<li>9th. A chief among mountains smokes.
</li>
<li>10th. A chief among mountains is satisfied.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>When the people came up from the lower world they were under twelve chiefs, but only
six of them joined in the singing these songs, and to-day six men sing them. When
the mountains were made, the god of each of the four quarters of the world carried
one away and placed it where it now stands. The other two were left in the middle
of the world and are there still. A pair of gods were then put to live in each mountain,
as follows: East, Dawn Boy and Dawn Girl, called also White Shell Boy and White Shell
Girl; south, Turquoise Boy and Turquoise Girl; west, Twilight Boy and Haliotis Girl;
north, Darkness (or Cannel Coal) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>Boy and Darkness Girl: at Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>, All-goods (Yú<i>d</i>i-al<i>t</i><i>h</i>asaí) Boy and All-goods Girl; at T<i>s</i>olíhi, All-jewels (&#x12c;nkl&#x12d;&#x2032;z-al<i>t</i><i>h</i>asaí) Boy and All-jewels Girl.
</p>
<p>Version B speaks of the making of only four mountains, and very briefly of this.
</p>
<p id="not52"><span class="parNum">52.</span> Ts&#x12d;s-na-d<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n-i is the name of the sacred mountain which the Navahoes regard as bounding their
country on the east. It probably means Dark Horizontal Belt. The mountain is somewhere
near the pueblo of Jemez, in Bernalillo County, New Mexico. It is probably Pelado
Peak, 11,260 feet high, 20 miles N.N.E. of the pueblo. White shell and various other
objects of white&#x2014;the color of the east&#x2014;belong to the mountain.

They were brought up from the lower world as small images of stone; but as soon
as they were put in the mountain they came to life.
</p>
<p id="not54"><span class="parNum">54.</span> Tsó-ts&#x12d;<i>l</i>, or Tsó&#x2bb;-ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>, from tso, great, and ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>, a mountain, is the Navaho name of a peak 11,389 feet high in Valencia County, New
Mexico. Its summit is over twelve miles distant, in a direct line, east by north,
from McCarty&#x2019;s Station on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. It is called by the Mexicans
San Mateo, and was on September 18, 1849, named Mt. Taylor, &#x201c;in honor of the President
of the United States,&#x201d; by Lieut. J.&nbsp;H. Simpson, U.S. Army.<a href="#not328" class="noteref">328</a> On the maps of the United States Geological Survey, the whole mountain mass is marked
&#x201c;San Mateo Mountains,&#x201d; and the name &#x201c;Mount Taylor&#x201d; is reserved for the highest peak.
This is one of the sacred mountains of the Navahoes, and is regarded by them as bounding
their country on the south, although at the present day some of the tribe live south
of the mountain. They say that San Mateo is the mountain of the south and San Francisco
is the mountain of the west, yet the two peaks are nearly in the same latitude. One
version of the Origin Legend (Version B) makes San Mateo the mountain of the east,
but all other versions differ from this. Blue being the color of the south, turquoise
and other blue things, as named in the myth, belong to this mountain. As blue also
symbolizes the female, she-rain belongs to San Mateo. <a href="#plate3">Plate III.</a> is from a photograph taken somewhere in the neighborhood of Chavez Station, about
thirty-five miles in a westerly direction from the summit of the mountain.

<p id="not56"><span class="parNum">56.</span> <i>D</i>o-kos-lí<i>d</i> or <i>D</i>o-ko-os-l&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>d</i>, is the Navaho name of San Francisco Mountain, one of the most prominent landmarks
in Arizona. The summit of this peak is distant in a direct line about twelve miles
nearly north from the town of Flagstaff, on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, in
Yavapai County, Arizona. The precise meaning of the Indian name has not been ascertained,
but the name seems to contain, modified, the words <i>t</i>o&#x2bb; and kos, the former meaning water and the latter cloud. It is the sacred mountain
of the Navahoes, which they regard as bounding their land on the west. The color of
the west, yellow, and the various things, mostly yellow, which symbolize the west,
as mentioned in the myth, are sacred to it. Haliotis shell, although highly iridescent,
is regarded by the Navahoes as yellow, and hence is the shell sacred to the mountain.
In Navaho sacred songs, the peak is called, figuratively, The Wand of Haliotis. <a href="#plate2">Plate II.</a> is from a photograph taken on the south side of the mountain, at a point close to
the railroad, two or three miles east of Flagstaff.
</p>
<p id="not57"><span class="parNum">57.</span> The name Na-<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>-kai A-<i>s</i>i-ké (White Corn Boy) is from na<i>t</i>á<i>n</i> (corn), <i>l</i>a<i>k</i>aí (white), and a<i>s</i>iké or &#x12d;<i>s</i>ké (boy). The name Na<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>tsoi A<i>t</i>é<i>t</i> (Yellow Corn Girl), comes from na<i>t</i>á<i>n</i> (corn), <i>l</i>&#x12d;tsói (yellow), and a<i>t</i>é<i>t</i> (girl). In <a href="#par291">paragraph 291</a> mention is made of the creation of a White Corn Boy and a Yellow Corn Girl. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>It is not certain whether these are the same as the deities of <i>D</i>okoslí<i>d</i>, but it is probable the Navahoes believe in more than one divine pair with these
names.

<p id="not58"><span class="parNum">58.</span> <i>D</i>ep&#x115;&#x2032;ntsa, the Navaho name for the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado, is
derived from two words,&#x2014;<i>d</i>epé (the Rocky Mountain sheep) and intsá (scattered all over, widely distributed).
These mountains are said to bound the Navaho land on the north. Somewhere among them
lies Ní<i>h</i>oyost<i>s</i>át<i>s</i>e, the Place of Emergence (note <a href="#not43">43</a>). Black being the color of the north, various black things, such as pás<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni (cannel coal),<a href="#not158" class="noteref">158</a> blackbirds, etc., belong to these mountains. There are many peaks in this range from
10,000 to 14,000 feet high.

<p id="not60"><span class="parNum">60.</span> Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>-ná-o-<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i> seems to mean a mountain encircled with blood, but the Navahoes declare that such
is not the meaning. They say it means the mountain that has been encircled by people
travelling around it, and that, when Estsánatlehi and her people lived there they
moved their camp to various places around the base of the mountain. Of course this
is all mythical. Had the author ever seen this mountain, he might conjecture the significance
of the name; but he does not even know its location. The name of the Carrizo Mountains,
Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náods&#x12d;<i>l</i>, meaning Mountain Surrounded with Mountains, is nearly the same; but when the writer
visited the Carrizo Mountains in 1892 he was assured by the Indians that the sacred
hill was not there. Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i> is rendered in this work Encircled Mountain, which is only an approximate translation.

<p><span class="parNum">65.</span> A-k&#x12d;-<i>d</i>a-nas-<i>t</i>á-ni, signifying One-round-thing-sitting-on-top-of-another, is the Navaho name of

but never could procure a piece of it. They offered to exchange for another piece,
but would not sell. A stone (Chinese idol) which they pronounced similar was analyzed
by the chemists of the United States Geological Survey in Washington, and found to
be silicate of magnesia, probably pyrophyllite. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>Such, perhaps, is the mirage-stone. The author offered the Chinese idol to one of

</p>
<p id="not68"><span class="parNum">68.</span> The subject of the dead belonging to the Sun and the Moon is explained at length
in the version of Náltsos Nigéhani (Version B) thus: &#x201c;On the fifth day (after the
people came up to the surface of this world) the sun climbed as usual to the zenith
and (then) stopped. The day grew hot and all longed for the night to come, but the
sun moved not. Then the wise Coyote said: &#x2018;The sun stops because he has not been paid
for his work; he demands a human life for every day that he labors; he will not move
again till some one dies.&#x2019; At length a woman, the wife of a great chief, ceased to
breathe and grew cold, and while they all drew around in wonder, the sun was observed
to move again, and he travelled down the sky and passed behind the western mountains.&#x2026;
That night the moon stopped in the zenith, as the sun had done during the day; and
the Coyote told the people that the moon also demanded pay and would not move until
it was given. He had scarcely spoken when the man who had seen the departed woman
in the nether world died, and the moon, satisfied, journeyed to the west. Thus it
is that some one must die every night, or the moon would not move across the sky.
But the separation of the tribes occurred immediately after this, and now the moon
takes his pay from among the alien races, while the sun demands the life of a Navaho
as his fee for passing every day over the earth.&#x201d;
</p>
<p id="not69"><span class="parNum">69.</span> Many of the Indians tell that the world was originally small and was increased in
size. The following is the version of Náltsos Nigéhani (B): &#x201c;The mountains that bounded
the world were not so far apart then as they are now; hence the world was smaller,
and when the sun went over the earth he came nearer to the surface than he does now.
So the first day the sun went on his journey it was intolerably hot; the people were
almost burned to death, and they prayed to the four winds that each one would pull
his mountain away from the centre of the earth, and thus widen the borders of the
world. It was done as they desired, and the seas that bounded the land receded before
the mountains. But on the second day, although the weather was milder, it was still
too hot, and again were the mountains and seas removed. All this occurred again on
the third day; but on the fourth day they found the weather pleasant, and they prayed
no more for the earth to be changed.&#x201d;

<p id="not70"><span class="parNum">70.</span> The story of the making of the stars is told in essentially the same way by many
story-tellers. It is surprising that <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i N&#x115;z totally omitted it. The following is the tale as told by Náltsos Nigéhani: &#x201c;Now
First Man and First Woman thought it would be better if the sky had more lights, for
there were times when the moon did not shine at night. So they gathered a number of
fragments of sparkling mica of which to make stars, and First Man proceeded to lay
out a plan of the heavens, on the ground. He put a little fragment in the north, where
he wished to have the star that would never move, and he placed near it seven great
pieces, which are the seven stars we behold in the north now. He put a great bright
one in the south, another in the east, and a third in the west, and then went on to
plan various constellations, when along came Coyote, who, seeing that three pieces
were red, exclaimed, &#x2018;These shall be my stars, and I will place them where I think
best;&#x2019; so he put them in situations corresponding to places that three great red stars
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>now occupy among the celestial lights. Before First Man got through with his work,
Coyote became impatient, and, saying, &#x2018;Oh! they will do as they are,&#x2019; he hastily gathered
the fragments of mica, threw them upwards, and blew a strong breath after them. Instantly
they stuck to the sky. Those to which locations had been assigned adhered in their
proper places; but the others were scattered at random and in formless clusters over
the firmament.&#x201d; See &#x201c;A Part of the Navajo&#x2019;s Mythology,&#x201d; pp. 7, 8.<a href="#not306" class="noteref">306</a>

and tyel, broad) means simply Broad Pueblo,&#x2014;one covering much ground. It is applied
to at least two ruined pueblos in the Navaho country. One of these&#x2014;the Pueblo Grande
of the Mexicans, situated &#x201c;twenty-two or twenty-three miles north of Navaho Springs,&#x201d;
a station on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, in Arizona&#x2014;is well described and depicted
by Mr. Victor Mindeleff in his &#x201c;Study of Pueblo Architecture.&#x201d;<a href="#not326" class="noteref">326</a> The other&#x2014;the K&#x12d;ntyél to which reference is made in this story&#x2014;is in the Chaco Canyon,
in New Mexico. With its name spelled &#x201c;Kintail,&#x201d; and rendered &#x201c;the Navajo name for
ruin,&#x201d; it is mentioned by Mr. F.&nbsp;T. Bickford,<a href="#not293" class="noteref">293</a> and one of his pictures, probably representing K&#x12d;ntyél, is here reproduced (<a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>). In the <i>Journal of American Folk-Lore</i>, April-June, 1889, the author says: &#x201c;I have reason to believe that this pueblo is
identical with that seen and described in 1849 by Lieut. J.&nbsp;H. Simpson, U.S.A., under
the name of Pueblo Chettro Kettle.&#x201d;
</p>
<p id="not73"><span class="parNum">73.</span> The name <i>H</i>as-t<i>s</i>é-yal-<i>t</i>i, spelled according to the alphabet of the Bureau of Ethnology &#x201c;Qastcéyalçi&#x201d; may
be translated Talking God, or Talking Elder of the Gods. <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i is otherwise called Yéb&#x12d;t<i>s</i>ai, or the Maternal Grandfather of the Gods. He is a chief or leader among several
groups of local divinities who are said to dwell at K&#x12d;ninaékai, in the Chelly Canyon,
at Ts&#x115;&#x2032;nit<i>s</i>e, Tsé&#x2bb;híhi, and at various other sacred places. Although called a talking god, the
man who personates him in the rites never speaks while in character, but utters a
peculiar whoop and makes signs. In the myths, however, the god is represented as speaking,
usually after he has whooped and made signs. (<a href="#par472">Par. 472</a>.) He is a beneficent character, always ready to help man and rescue him from peril.
He is sometimes spoken of and prayed to as if there were but one, but the myths show
that the Navahoes believe in many gods of this name, and in some prayers it is distinctly
specified which one is meant by naming his home in connection with him. In <a href="#plate1">plate I.</a> he is shown, as represented in the dry-paintings, carrying a tobacco bag made of
the skin of Abert&#x2019;s squirrel (<i lang="la">Sciurus aberti</i>). In the picture the black <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>tips of toes, nose, and ears, and the reddish (chestnut) spot on the back of the squirrel,
are carefully indicated. The dry-painting shows the more important characters of the
mask worn by the personator,&#x2014;the eagle-plumes at the back, the owl-feathers at the
base of the plume-ornament, and the peculiar symbols at mouth and eyes,&#x2014;but it does
not show the cornstalk symbol over the nose. <a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a>, taken from a photograph, shows the mask trimmed with its collar of fresh spruce
boughs, as it appears when used in the dance of naak<i>h</i>aí on the last night of the ceremony of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>. The personator of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i has his whole person clothed, while the representatives of other gods go nearly
naked. The proper covering for his back is a number of finely dressed deerskins, one
over another, tied together in front by the skins of the legs; but of late years the
masquerader often appears in an ordinary calico shirt. The symbol surrounding each
of the holes for the eyes and mouth is this <span><img src="images/sy225.png" alt="[symbol]" width="26" height="12"></span>. It is said to represent the storm cloud hanging above, and the mist rising from
below to meet it. Thus cloud and mist often appear in the mountains of the Navaho
land during the rainy season, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i or the Yéb&#x12d;t<i>s</i>ai is the principal character in the great rite of <span class="corr" id="xd29e12629" title="Source: klédzi">kléd<i>z</i>i</span> <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or the night chant. Our people, who often go to witness the public performance of
the last night in this rite, call it the Yéb&#x12d;t<i>s</i>ai (Yáybichy) dance. The songs and prayers in which <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i is mentioned are numerous.

<p id="not74"><span class="parNum">74.</span> <i>H</i>as-t<i>s</i>é-<i>h</i>o-<i>g</i>an, spelled with alphabet of Bureau of Ethnology, Qastcéqogan, may be freely translated
House God. <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an is one of the leading personages in each of the local groups of the yéi, or divine
beings, who dwell in caves and old cliff-dwellings. He is commonly spoken of as if
there were but one; but an examination of the myths shows that the Navahoes believe
in many of these gods. Those of Tse&#x2bb;gíhi, T<i>s</i>é&#x2bb;ni<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an, Tsé&#x2bb;nit<i>s</i>e, Kininaékai, and the sacred mountains are the ones most commonly worshipped. In
most myths he appears as second in authority to <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i, the Talking God, but occasionally he is represented as equal or even superior to
the latter. He is a farm god as well as a house god. To him are attributed the farm-songs
sung during the night chant (see <a href="#not322">note 322</a>), and many other songs. He is a beneficent character and a friend to man. There are
many songs and prayers in his honor. In the rite of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or the night chant, he is represented in the dance by a man wearing a collar of
spruce, a blue mask decorated with eagle-plumes and moccasins, with shirt and leggings,
which should be (but of late years are not always) of buckskin. He is depicted in
the dry-paintings thus (see <a href="#plate1">plate I.</a>, fig. 1): He wears a black shirt ornamented with four star-like ornaments embroidered
in porcupine quills, and having a fancy fringe of porcupine quills at the bottom;
white buckskin leggings; colored garters; quill-embroidered moccasins, tied on with
white strings; long ear-pendants of turquoise and coral; bracelets of the same; an
otter-skin (hanging below the right ear), from which depend six buckskin strings with
colored porcupine quills wrapped around them; a cap-like (male) mask painted blue,
fringed with red hair, and adorned with eagle-plumes and owl-feathers. He carries
a staff (g&#x12d;<i>s</i>) painted black (with the charcoal of four sacred plants), streaked transversely with
white, and adorned with a single cluster of turkey tail-feathers arranged as a whorl,
and two eagle plumes, which, like the plumes on the head, are tipped with small, downy
eagle-feathers. The yellow stripe at the chin indicates a similar stripe on the mask
actually worn, and symbolizes the yellow light of evening (na<i>h</i>otsóí). The neck of this as well as the other divine figures is painted blue, and
crossed with four stripes in red. Some say that this indicates the larynx with its
cartilaginous rings; others say that it represents the collar of spruce-twigs; others
are uncertain of its meaning. If it does not represent the spruce collars, it represents
nothing in the costume of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>the <span class="corr" id="xd29e12724" title="Source: maquerader">masquerader</span>, which, in other respects, except the quill embroideries, agrees closely with the
picture, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i is also a dawn god, <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>h</i>o<i>g</i>an a god of evening.
</p>
<p id="not75"><span class="parNum">75.</span> In the Navaho tales, men frequently receive friendly warnings or advice from wind
gods who whisper into their ears. Some story-tellers&#x2014;as in the version of the origin
myth here given&#x2014;speak of one wind god only, whom they call simply N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i (Wind); while others&#x2014;as in the story of <span class="corr" id="xd29e12748" title="Source: Nat&#x12d;&#x2032;nesthani">Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani</span>&#x2014;speak of N&#x12d;&#x2032;lt<i>s</i>i-<i>d</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; (Wind People) and N&#x12d;l<i>t</i>siá<i>z</i>i-<i>d</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; (Little Wind People) as the friendly prompters.

<p id="not76"><span class="parNum">76.</span> The game of nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i>, as played by the Navahoes, is much the same as the game of chungkee played by the
Mandans, described and depicted by Catlin in his &#x201c;North American Indians,&#x201d;<a href="#not296" class="noteref">296</a> vol. i., page 132, plate 59. A hoop is rolled along the ground and long poles are
thrown after it. The Mandan pole was made of a single piece of wood. The pole of the
Navahoes is made of two pieces, usually alder, each a natural fathom long; the pieces
overlap and are bound together by a long branching strap of hide called <i>t</i><i>h</i>ágib&#x12d;ke, or turkey-claw.
</p>
<p id="not77"><span class="parNum">77.</span> These shells may not be altogether mythical. Possibly they are the same as those
described in the story of &#x201c;The Great Shell of K&#x12d;ntyél&#x201d; given in this book.
</p>
<p id="not78"><span class="parNum">78.</span> Vague descriptions only of Bé-ko-t<i>s</i>&#x12d;-<i>d</i>i so far have been obtained. He is not represented by any masked characters in the
ceremonies, or by any picture in the dry-paintings. No description of his appearance
has been recorded, except that he looks like an old man. There is a myth concerning
him of which a brief epitome has been recorded. There are four songs of sequence connected
with this myth. If a Navaho wants a fine horse, he thinks he may get it by singing
the second and third of these songs and praying to Békot<i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>d</i>i. In his prayer he specifies the color and appearance of the horse desired. Some
say that Békot<i>s</i>&#x12d;<i>d</i>i made all the animals whose creation is not otherwise accounted for in the myths.
Others say that he and the Sun made the animals together. Others, again, limit his
creation work to the larger game animals and the modern domestic animals. In this
paragraph (<a href="#par228">228</a>) it is said he is the god who carries the moon, while in <a href="#par199">paragraph 199</a> it is said the moon-bearer is Kléhanoai. Perhaps these are two names for one character.
Some say he is the same as the God of the Americans.

<p id="not79"><span class="parNum">79.</span> <span lang="es">Bayeta</span>, Spanish for baize. The variety of baize which finds its way into the Navaho country
is dyed some shade of crimson, and has a very long nap. It is supposed to be made
in England especially for the Spanish-American trade, for each original bale bears
a gaudy colored label with an inscription in Spanish. It takes the place in the Southwest
of the scarlet strouding which used to form such an important article in the trade
of our northern tribes. The bright red figures in the finer Navaho blankets, fifteen
years or more ago, were all made of threads of ravelled <span lang="es">bayeta</span>.
</p>
<p id="not80"><span class="parNum">80.</span> The coyote, or prairie-wolf (<i lang="la">Canis latrans</i>), would seem to be regarded by the Navahoes as the type, or standard for comparison,
among the wild <i lang="la">Canidæ</i> of the Southwest. The coyote is called mai; the great wolf, maítso, which means great
coyote; and the kit fox (<i lang="la">Vulpes velox</i>) is called mai<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>, which means blue or gray coyote.
</p>
<p id="not81"><span class="parNum">81.</span> Some versions say there were twelve brothers and one sister in this divine family,
making thirteen in all. In this version the narrator tells how another brother was
created by Estsánatlehi to make up for the loss of <i>L</i>éyaneyani, who left the brotherhood. (<a href="#par417">Par. 417</a>.) Although called <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; Naki<i>d</i>á<i>t</i>a, or the Twelve People, these brothers are evidently divinities. True, they once
died; but they came to life again and are now immortal. They are gifted with superhuman
powers.

<p id="not82"><span class="parNum">82.</span> The sweat-house of the Navahoes (<a href="#par25">par. 25</a>, <a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>) is usually not more than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>three feet high. Diaphoresis is produced on the principle of the Turkish (not the
Russian) bath. While the Indians of the North pour water on the hot stones and give
a steam bath, the Navahoes simply place stones, heated in a fire outside, on the floor
of the sweat-house, cover the entrance with blankets, and thus raise a high heat that
produces violent perspiration. When the occupant comes out, if the bath is not ceremonial,
he rolls himself in the sand, and, when his skin is thus dried, he brushes the sand
away. He usually returns then to the sweat-house, and may repeat the operation several
times in a single afternoon. If the sweat is ceremonial, the bath of yucca suds usually
follows (see note <a href="#not10">10</a>), and the subject is dried with corn meal.

<p id="not83"><span class="parNum">83.</span> One version relates that, before they entered the sudatory, Coyote proposed they
should produce emesis by tickling their throats,&#x2014;a common practice among the Navahoes.
He placed a large piece of pine bark before each, as a dish, and bade Yé<i>l</i>apahi keep his eyes shut till he was told to open them. That day Coyote had fared
poorly. He had found nothing to eat but a few bugs and worms, while Yé<i>l</i>apahi had dined heartily on fat venison. When the emesis was over, Coyote exchanged
the bark dishes and said to Yé<i>l</i>apahi: &#x201c;Open your eyes and see what bad things you have had in your stomach. These
are the things that make you sick.&#x201d; The giant opened his eyes and beheld on the bark
a lot of bugs and worms. &#x201c;It is true, my friend, what you tell me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;How
did I get such vile things into me? No wonder I could not run fast.&#x201d; Coyote then told
the giant to go before him into the sudatory, and when the giant had turned his back
the hungry Coyote promptly devoured the contents of the other dish of bark.

<p id="not84"><span class="parNum">84.</span> The word <i>t</i>óhe (Englished thóhay), which may be interpreted stand, stick, or stay, is, in various
rites, shouted in an authoritative tone when it is desired that some object shall
obey the will of the conjurer. Thus in the dance of the standing arcs, as practised
in the rite of the mountain chant, when an arc is placed on the head of a performer,
and it is intended that it should stand without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>apparent means of support, the cry &#x201c;<i>t</i>óhe&#x201d; is frequently repeated. (See &#x201c;The Mountain Chant,&#x201d;<a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a> p. 437.)
</p>
<p id="not85"><span class="parNum">85.</span> The statement that the hair of the gods, both friendly and alien, is yellow, is made
in other tales also. The hair of the ceremonial masks is reddish or yellowish. (See
plates IV. and VII.) The hair of the gods is represented by red in the dry-pictures.
Dull tints of red are often called yellow by the Navahoes. Various conjectures may
be made to account for these facts.
</p>
<p id="not86"><span class="parNum">86.</span> The bridge of rainbow, as well as the trail of rainbow, is frequently introduced
into Navaho tales. The Navaho land abounds in deep chasms and canyons, and the divine
ones, in their wanderings, are said to bridge the canyons by producing rainbows. In
the myth of &#x201c;The Mountain Chant,&#x201d; p. 399 (note <a href="#not314">314</a>), the god <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i is represented as making a rainbow bridge for the hero to walk on. The hero steps
on the bow, but sinks in it because the bow is soft; then the god blows a breath that
hardens the bow, and the man walks on it with ease. A natural bridge near Fort Defiance,
Arizona, is thought by the Navahoes to have been originally one of the rainbow bridges
of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i (See <a href="#fig38">fig. 38</a>.)

<p id="not88"><span class="parNum">88.</span> This legend and nearly all the legends of the Navaho make frequent allusions to yucca.
Four kinds are mentioned: 1st, tsási or <i>h</i>a<i>s</i>kán. <i lang="la">Yucca baccata</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>(Torrey); 2d, tsasitsóz, or slender yucca, <i lang="la">Yucca glauca</i> (Nuttall), <i lang="la">Yucca angustifolia</i> (Pursh); 3d, y&#x115;b&#x12d;tsasi, or yucca of the gods, probably <i lang="la">Yucca radiosa</i> (Trelease), <i lang="la">Yucca elata</i> (Engelmann); 4th, tsasib&#x12d;<i>t</i>é or horned yucca, which seems to be but a stunted form or dwarf variety of <i lang="la">Yucca baccata</i>, never seen in bloom or in fruit by the author. Tsási is used as a generic name.
All kinds are employed in the rites, sometimes indifferently; at other times only
a certain species may be used. Thus in the sacred game of k&#x115;s&#x12d;t<i>s</i>é,<a href="#not176" class="noteref">176</a> the counters are made of the leaves of <i lang="la">Y. glauca</i>; in the initiation into the mystery of the Yéb&#x12d;t<i>s</i>ai, the candidate is flogged with the leaf of <i lang="la">Y. baccata</i>. <a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a> represents a mask used in the rites of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, which must be made only of the leaves of <i lang="la">Y. baccata</i>, culled with many singular observances. All these yuccas have saponine in their roots
(which are known as <i>t</i>álawu<i>s</i> or foam), and all are used for cleansing purposes. All have, in their leaves, long
tough fibres which are utilized for all the purposes to which such fibres may be applied.
One species only, <i lang="la">Yucca baccata</i>, has an edible fruit. This is called <i>h</i>a<i>s</i>kán (from <i>h</i>o<i>s</i>, thorny, and kan, sweet), a name sometimes applied to the whole plant. The fruit
is eaten raw and made into a tough, dense jelly, both by the Navaho and Pueblo Indians.
The first and second kinds grow abundantly in the Navaho country; the third and fourth
kinds are rarer. <a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a> represents a drumstick used in the rites of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, which must be made only of four leaves of <i lang="la">Yucca baccata</i>. The intricate observances connected with the manufacture, use, destruction, and
sacrifice of this drumstick have already been described by the author.<a href="#not321" class="noteref">321</a>

<p id="not90"><span class="parNum">90.</span> T<i>s</i>iké <i>S</i>a<i>s</i> Nátlehi means literally Young Woman Who Changes to a Bear, or Maid Who Becomes a
Bear. To judge from this tale, it might be thought that there was but one such character
in the Navaho mythology and that she had died. But it appears from other legends and
from rituals that the Navahoes believe in several such maidens, some of whom exist
to this day. The hill of T<i>s</i>ú<i>s</i>kai (<a href="#not9">note 9</a>) is said in the myth of ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>y&#x12d;&#x2032;d<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> to be the home of several of the T<i>s</i>iké <i>S</i>a<i>s</i> Nátlehi now. It would seem from the songs of ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>y&#x12d;&#x2032;d<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> that the Maid Who Becomes a Bear of later days is not considered as malevolent as
the first of her kind. Her succor is sought by the sick.

to the legend, other bands of <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; who had escaped the fury of the alien gods, existed at this time, and when they

</p>
<p id="not93"><span class="parNum">93.</span> The gods, and such men as they favor, are represented in the tales as making rapid
and easy journeys on rainbows, sunbeams, and streaks of lightning. Such miraculous
paths are called e<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni, or holy trails. They are also represented as using sunbeams like rafts to float
through the air.

for her creation in other ways. Version A.&#x2014;First Man and First Woman stayed at <span class="corr" id="xd29e13154" title="Source: Ds&#x12d;lnáot&#x12d;l">Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i></span> and camped in various places around the mountain. One day a black cloud descended
on the mountain of T<i>s</i>olíhi, and remained there four days. First Man said: &#x201c;Surely something has happened
from this; let some one go over there and see.&#x201d; First Woman went. She approached the
mountain from the east, and wound four times around it in ascending it. On the top
she found a female infant, who was the daughter of the Earth Mother (Naestsán, the
Woman Horizontal) and the Sky Father (Yá<i>d</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>y&#x12d;<i>l</i>, the Upper Darkness). She picked up the child, who till that moment had been silent;
but as soon as she was lifted she began to cry, and never ceased crying until she
got home to Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>náo<i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>. Salt Woman said she wanted the child. It is thought the sun fed the infant on pollen,
for there was no one to nurse it. In twelve days she grew to be a big girl, and in
eighteen days she became a woman, and they held the nubile ceremony over her. Twelve
songs belong to this ceremony. Version B only says that First Woman found the infant
lying on the ground and took it home to rear it. (See &#x201c;Some Deities and Demons of
the Navajos,&#x201d;<a href="#not313" class="noteref">313</a> pp. 844, 846.)

<p id="not98"><span class="parNum">98.</span> <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;-ne-n&#x12d;-li or <i>T</i>ó-ne-n&#x12d;-li, Water Sprinkler, is an important character in Navaho mythology. He is
a rain-god. In the dry-paintings of the Navaho rites he is shown as wearing a blue
mask bordered with red, and trimmed on top with life-feathers. Sometimes he is represented
carrying a water-pot. In the rite of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, during the public dance of the last night, he is represented by a masked man who
enacts the part of a clown. While other masked men are dancing, this clown performs
various antics according to his caprice. He walks along the line of dancers, gets
in their way, dances out of order and out of time, peers foolishly at different persons,
or sits on the ground, his hands clasped across his knees, his body rocking to and
fro. At times he joins regularly in the dance; toward the close of a figure, and when
the others have retired, pretending he is unaware of their departure, he remains,
going through his steps. Then, feigning to suddenly discover the absence of the dancers,
he follows them on a full run. Sometimes he carries a fox-skin, drops it on the ground,
walks away as if unconscious of his loss; then, pretending to become aware of his
loss, he turns around and acts as if searching anxiously for the skin, which lies
plainly in sight. He screens his eyes with his hand and crouches low to look. Then,
pretending to find the skin, he jumps on it and beats it as if it were a live animal
that he seeks to kill. Next he shoulders and carries it as if it were a heavy burden.
With such antics the personator of <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;nen&#x12d;li assists in varying the monotony of the long night&#x2019;s performance. Though shown
as a fool in the rites, he is not so shown in the myths.

<p id="not101"><span class="parNum">101.</span> Other versions make Estsánatlehi the mother of both War Gods, and give a less imaginative
account of their conception. Version A.&#x2014;The maiden Estsánatlehi went out to get wood.
She collected a bundle, tied it with a rope, and when she knelt down to lift it she
felt a foot pressed upon her back; she looked up and saw no one. Three times more
kneeling, she felt the pressure of the foot. When she looked up for the fourth time,
she saw a man. &#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Near by,&#x201d; she replied, pointing to
her home. &#x201c;On yonder mountain,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you will find four yuccas, each of a different
kind, cut on the north side to mark them. Dig the roots of these yuccas and make yourself
a bath. Get meal of <i>t</i>ohono<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni corn (note <a href="#not28">28</a>), yellow from your mother, white from your father (note <a href="#not27">27</a>). Then build yourself a brush shelter away from your hut and sleep there four nights.&#x201d;
She went home and told all this to her foster parents. They followed all the directions
of the mysterious visitor, for they knew he was the Sun. During three nights nothing
happened in the brush shelter that she knew of. On the morning after the fourth night
she was awakened from her sleep by the sound of departing footsteps, and, looking
in the direction that she heard them, she saw the sun rising. Four days after this
(or twelve days, as some say) Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni was born. Four days later she went to cleanse
herself at a spring, and there she conceived of the water, and in four days more <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni, the second War God, was born to her. Version B.&#x2014;The Sun (or bearer of the sun)
met her in the woods and designated a trysting place. Here First Man built a corral
of branches. Sun visited her, in the form of an ordinary man, in the corral, four
nights in succession. Four days after the last visit she gave birth to twins, who
were Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni and <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni. (See &#x201c;A Part of the Navajos&#x2019; Mythology,&#x201d;<a href="#not306" class="noteref">306</a> pp. 9, 10.)

rungs to the ladder. She had many seats in her house. The elder brother sat on a seat
of obsidian; the younger, on a seat of turquoise. She offered them food of four kinds
to eat; they only accepted one kind. When they had eaten, a small image of obsidian
came out from an apartment in the east and stood on a serrated platform, or platform
of serrate knives. The elder brother stood on the platform beside the image. Spider
Woman blew a strong breath four times on the image in the direction of the youth,
and the latter became thus endowed with the hard nature of the obsidian, which was
to further preserve him in his future trials. From the south room came a turquoise
image, and stood on a serrated platform. The younger brother stood beside this. Spider
Woman blew on the turquoise image toward him, and he thus acquired the hard nature
of the blue stone. To-day in the rites of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> they have a prayer concerning these incidents beginning, &#x201c;Now I stand on pé<i>s</i><i>d</i>olgas.&#x201d; (See note <a href="#not264">264</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not110"><span class="parNum">110.</span> In describing the journey of the War Gods to the house of the Sun, version A adds
something. At <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;sa<i>t</i>o or Hot Spring (Ojo Gallina, near San Rafael), the brothers have an adventure with
Tiéholtsodi, the water monster, who threatens them and is appeased with prayer. They
encounter Old Age People, who treat them kindly, but bid them not follow the trail
that leads to the house of Old Age. They come to <i>H</i>ayo<i>l</i>ká<i>l</i>, Daylight, which rises like a great range of mountains in front of them. (Songs.)
They fear they will have to cross this, but Daylight rises from the ground and lets
them pass under.&#x2026; They come to T<i>s</i>a<i>l</i>yé<i>l</i>, Darkness. Wind whispers into their ears what songs to sing. They sing these songs
and T<i>s</i>a<i>l</i>yé<i>l</i> rises and lets them pass under. They come to water, which they walk over. On the
other side they meet their sister, the daughter of the Sun, who dwells in the house
of the Sun. She speaks not, but turns silently around, and they follow her to the
house.
</p>
<p id="not111"><span class="parNum">111.</span> According to version A, there were four sentinels of each kind, and they lay in the
passageway or entrance to the house. A curtain hung in front of each group of four.
In each group the first sentinel was black, the second blue, the third yellow, the
fourth white. The brothers sang songs to the guardians and sprinkled pollen on them.
</p>
<p id="not112"><span class="parNum">112.</span> Version A gives the names of these two young men as Black Thunder and Blue Thunder.
</p>
<p id="not113"><span class="parNum">113.</span> The teller of the version has omitted to mention that the brothers, when they entered
the house, declared that they came to seek their father, but other story-tellers do
not fail to tell this.
</p>
<p id="not114"><span class="parNum">114.</span> Four articles of armor were given to each, and six different kinds of weapons were
given to them. The articles of armor were: pe<i>s</i>ké (knife moccasins), pe<i>s</i>&#x12d;stlê&#x2032; (knife leggings), pe<i>s</i>ê&#x2032; (knife shirt), and pe<i>s</i>t<i>s</i>á (knife hat). The word &#x201c;pe<i>s</i>&#x201d; in the above names for armor, is here translated knife. The term was originally
applied to flint knives, and to the flakes from which flint knives were made. After
the introduction of European tools, the meaning was extended to include iron knives,
and now it is applied to any object of iron, and, with qualifying suffixes, to all
kinds of metal. Thus copper is pe<i>s</i><i>l</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>í, or red metal, and silver, pe<i>s</i><i>l</i>akaí, or white metal. Many of the Navahoes now think that the mythic armor of their
gods was of iron. Such the author believed it to be in the earlier <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>years of his investigation among the Navahoes, and he was inclined to believe that
they borrowed the idea of armored heroes from the Spanish invaders of the sixteenth
century. Later studies have led him to conclude that the conception of armored heroes
was not borrowed from the whites, and that the armor was supposed to be made of stone
flakes such as were employed in making knives in the prehistoric days. The Mokis believe
that their gods and heroes wore armor of flint.
</p>
<p id="not115"><span class="parNum">115.</span> The weapons were these:&#x2014;
</p>
<ul>
<li>ats&#x12d;nikl&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>s</i>ka (chain-lightning arrows)
</li>
<li><i>h</i>at<i>s</i>&#x12d;lk&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>s</i>ka or <i>h</i>a<i>d</i>&#x12d;lk&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>s</i>ka (sheet-lightning arrows)
</li>
<li><i>s</i>a&#x2bb;bitlólka (sunbeam arrows)
</li>
<li>natsil&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>t</i>ka (rainbow arrows)
</li>
<li>pe<i>s</i><i>h</i>ál (stone knife-club)
</li>
<li><i>h</i>atsoil<i>h</i>ál, which some say was a thunderbolt, and others say was a great stone knife, with
a blade as broad as the hand. Some say that only one stone knife was given, which
was for Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, and that only two thunderbolts were given, both of which were
for <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni. The man who now personates Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni in the rites carries a stone knife of
unusual size (<a href="#plate4">plate IV.</a>); and he who personates <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni carries in each hand a wooden cylinder (one black and one red) to represent a
thunderbolt. (<a href="#plate7">Plate VII.</a>)</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p id="not116"><span class="parNum">116.</span> Version A adds that when they were thus equipped they were dressed exactly like their
brothers Black Thunder and Blue Thunder, who dwelt in the house of the Sun.
</p>
<p id="not117"><span class="parNum">117.</span> The man who told this tale explained that there were sixteen poles in the east and
sixteen in the west to join earth and sky. Others say there were thirty-two poles
on each side. The Navahoes explain the annual progress of the sun by saying that at
the winter solstice he climbs on the pole farthest south in rising; that as the season
advances he climbs on poles farther and farther north, until at the summer solstice
he climbs the pole farthest north; that then he retraces his way, climbing different
poles until he reaches the south again. He is supposed to spend about an equal number
of days at each pole.
</p>
<p id="not118"><span class="parNum">118.</span> Many versions relate that the bearer of the sun rode a horse, or other pet animal.
The Navaho word here employed is <i>l</i>i<i>n</i>, which means any domesticated or pet animal, but now, especially, a horse. Version
A says the animal he rode was made of turquoise and larger than a horse. Such versions
have great difficulty in getting the horse up to the sky. Version A makes the sky
dip down and touch the earth to let the horse ascend. Of course the horse is a modern
addition to the tale. They never saw horses until the sixteenth century, and previous
to that time it is not known that any animal was ridden on the western continent.
Version B merely says that the Sun &#x201c;put on his robe of cloud, and, taking one of his
sons under each arm, he rose into the heavens.&#x201d;
</p>
<p id="not119"><span class="parNum">119.</span> Version B says they all ate a meal on their journey to the sky-hole. Version A says
that they ate for food, at the sky-hole, before the brothers descended, a mixture
of five kinds of pollen, viz.: pollen of white corn, pollen of yellow corn, pollen
of dawn, pollen of evening twilight, and pollen of the sun.<a href="#not11" class="noteref">11</a> These were mixed with <i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>l</i>anast<i>s</i>i, all kinds of water.<a href="#not67" class="noteref">67</a>
</p>
<p id="not120"><span class="parNum">120.</span> <i>T</i>ó&#x2bb;-sa-<i>t</i>o or Warm Spring is at the village of San Rafael, Valencia County, New Mexico. It
is about three miles in a southerly direction from Grant&#x2019;s, on the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad, five miles from the base and eighteen miles from the summit of Mount Taylor,
in a southwesterly direction from the latter. The lake referred to in the myth lies
about two miles southeast of the spring.
</p>
<p id="not121"><span class="parNum">121.</span> According to Version A, the monsters or anáye were all conceived in the fifth world
and born of one woman (a granddaughter of First Woman), who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>travelled much and rarely stayed at home. According to Version B, the monsters were
sent by First Woman, who became offended with man.
</p>
<p id="not122"><span class="parNum">122.</span> Version A gives, in addition to Tsóts&#x12d;<i>l</i>, the names of the other three hills over which Yéitso appeared. These were: in the
east, Sa&#x2bb;akéa&#x2bb;; in the south, Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>sit<i>s</i>í (Red Mountain); in the west, Tse&#x2bb;<i>l</i>painá<i>l</i>i (Brown Rock Hanging Down).

<p id="not123"><span class="parNum">123.</span> Version A.&#x2014;&#x201c;Hragh!&#x201d; said he, with a sigh of satisfaction (pantomimically expressed),

</p>
<p id="not126"><span class="parNum">126.</span> It is common in this and all other versions to show that evil turns to good (see
<a href="#par338">pars. 338</a>, <a href="#par345">345</a>, <a href="#par349">349</a>, <i>et al.</i>) and that the demons dead become useful to man in other forms. How the armor of Yéitso
became useful to man, the narrator here forgot to state; but it may be conjectured
that he should have said that it furnished flint flakes for knives and arrow-heads.
</p>
<p id="not127"><span class="parNum">127.</span> Other versions state, more particularly, that, in accordance with the Indian custom,
these names were given when the brothers returned to their home, and the ceremony
of rejoicing (the &#x201c;scalp-dance&#x201d;) was held for their first victory. Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni is
derived from na, or <span class="corr" id="xd29e13579" title="Source: ana">aná</span> (alien or enemy: see note <a href="#not7">7</a>); yéi, ye or ge (a genius or god; hence anáye, an alien god or giant: see <a href="#par80">par. 80</a>); n&#x115;zgá&#x2bb; (to kill with a blow or blows, as in killing with a club); and the suffix
ni (person). The name means, therefore, Slayer of the Alien Gods, or Slayer of Giants.
As the sounds of g and y before e are interchangeable in the Navaho language, the
name is heard pronounced both Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni and Nagén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni,&#x2014;about as often one way
as the other. In previous essays the author has spelled it in the latter way; but
in this work he gives preference to the former, since it is more in harmony with his
spelling of other names containing the word &#x201c;ye&#x201d; or &#x201c;yéi.&#x201d; (See <a href="#par78">par. 78</a>.) To&#x2bb;-ba-d<i>z</i>&#x12d;s-t<i>s</i>í-ni is derived from <i>t</i>o&#x2bb; (water), ba (for him), d<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>ín (born), and the suffix ni. The name therefore means, literally, Born for the Water;
but the expression bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>ín (born for him) denotes the relation of father and child,&#x2014;not of a mother and child,&#x2014;so
that a free translation of the name is Child of the Water. The second name of this
god, Naí<i>d</i>ik&#x12d;<i>s</i>i, is rarely used.
</p>
<p id="not128"><span class="parNum">128.</span> About 40 miles to the northeast of the top of Mt. San Mateo there is a dark, high
volcanic hill called by the Mexicans <i>El Cabezon</i>, or The Great Head. This is the object which, according to the Navaho story-tellers,
was the head of Yéitso. Around the base of San Mateo, chiefly toward the east and
north, there are several more high volcanic peaks, of less prominence than <i>El Cabezon</i>, which are said to have been the heads of other giants who were slain in a great
storm raised by the War Gods. (See <a href="#par358">pars. 358</a>, <a href="#par359">359</a>.) <a href="#plate5">Plate V.</a> shows six of these volcanic hills. The high truncated cone in the distance (17 miles
from the point of view) is <i>El Cabezon</i>. Captain Clarence E. Dutton, U.S.A., treats of the geologic character of these cones
in his work on Mount Taylor.<a href="#not299" class="noteref">299</a> <a href="#plate5">Plate V.</a> is taken from the same photograph as his plate XXI. In Lieut.

<p id="not129"><span class="parNum">129.</span> To the south and west of the San Mateo Mountains there is a great plain of lava rock

of having once been flowing. The rock is dark and has much resemblance to coagulated
blood. This is the material which, the Navahoes think, was once the blood of Yéitso.
In some places it looks as if the blood were suddenly arrested, forming high cliffs;
here the war god is supposed to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>stopped the flow with his knife. <a href="#plate6">Plate VI.</a> shows this lava in the valley of the Rio San José, from a photograph supplied by
the United States Geological Survey.

<p id="not130"><span class="parNum">130.</span> Version A adds some particulars to the account of the return of the brothers to their
home, after their encounter with Yéitso. They first went to Azíhi, the place at which
they descended when they came from the sky, and then to Kainipéhi. On their way home
they sang twenty songs&#x2014;the Ni<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>átsogis&#x12d;n&#x2014;which are sung to-day in the rites of <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>.

to the rites, and conducted the young heroes to their home.

called B&#x12d;-<i>t</i>é-&#x115;l-g&#x115;-<i>t</i>i, which is merely prefixing the personal pronoun &#x201c;his&#x201d; to the name. The exact etymology
has not been determined. The name has some reference to his horns; tê, or <i>t</i>e, meaning horns, and bi<i>t</i>é, his horns, in Navaho. All descriptions of this anáye are much alike. His father,
it is said, was an antelope horn.

<p id="not135"><span class="parNum">135.</span> Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;-ha-le. These mythic creatures, which in a previous paper, &#x201c;A Part of the
Navajos&#x2019; Mythology,&#x201d;<a href="#not306" class="noteref">306</a> the author calls harpies, from their analogy to the harpies of Greek mythology, are
believed in by many tribes of the Southwest. According to <i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i N&#x115;z they were the offspring of a bunch of eagle plumes.
</p>
<p id="not136"><span class="parNum">136.</span> Tsé&#x2bb;-b&#x12d;-<i>t</i>a-i, or Winged Rock, is a high, sharp pinnacle of dark volcanic rock, rising from
a wide plain in the northwestern part of New Mexico, about 12 miles from the western
boundary of the Territory, and about 20 miles from the northern boundary. The Navahoes
liken it to a bird, and hence the name of Winged Rock, or more literally Rock, Its
Wings. The whites think it resembles a ship with sails set, and call it Ship Rock.
Its bird-like appearance has probably suggested to the Navahoes the idea of making
it the mythic home of the bird-like Tse&#x2bb;n&#x103;&#x2032;hale.
</p>
<p id="not137"><span class="parNum">137.</span> There are many instances in Navaho language and legend where, when two things somewhat
resemble each other, but one is the coarser, the stronger, or the more violent, it
is spoken of as male, or associated with the male; while the finer, weaker, or more
gentle is spoken of as female, or associated with the female. Thus the turbulent San
Juan River is called, by the Navaho, <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;baká, or Male Water; while the placid Rio Grande is known as <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;baád, or Female Water. A shower accompanied by thunder and lightning is called n&#x12d;ltsabaká,
or male rain; a shower without electrical display is called n&#x12d;ltsabaád, or female
rain. In the myth of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani the mountain mahogany is said to be used for the male sacrificial cigarette, and
the cliff rose for the female. These two shrubs are much alike, particularly when
in fruit and decked with long plumose styles, but the former (the &#x201c;male&#x201d;) is the larger
and coarser shrub. In the myth of Ds&#x12d;<i>l</i>yi&#x2bb; Neyáni another instance may be found where mountain mahogany is associated with
the male, and the cliff rose with the female. Again, in the myth of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani a male cigarette is described as made of the coarse sunflower, while its associated
female is said to be made of the allied but more slender <i lang="la">Verbesina</i>. Instances of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>this character might be multiplied indefinitely. On this principle the north is associated
with the male, and the south with the female, for two reasons: 1st, cold, violent
winds blow from the north, while gentle, warm breezes blow from the south; 2d, the
land north of the Navaho country is more rough and mountainous than the land in the
south. In the former rise the great peaks of Colorado, while in the latter the hills
are not steep and none rise to the limit of eternal snow. A symbolism probably antecedent
to this has assigned black as the color of the north and blue as the color of the
south; so, in turn, black symbolizes the male and blue the female among the Navaho.

them.

for the number four, and the dependent poetic requirement which often constrains the
Navaho poet to put four stanzas in a song. <i>L</i>éyaneyani, or Reared Beneath the Earth (<a href="#par286">par. 286</a>), is an obscure hero whose only deed of valor, according to this version of the legend,
was the killing of his witch sister (<a href="#par281">par. 281</a>). The deeds of Tsówenatlehi, or the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>Changing Grandchild, are not known to the writer.

One version of this legend
says that Estsánatlehi hid her children under the ground when Yéitso came seeking
to devour them. This may have given rise to the idea that one of these children was
called, also, Reared Beneath the Earth.

<p>The above, it is said, are all places where constant springs of water (rare in the

every constant spring or watercourse has its water god.

<p id="not161"><span class="parNum">161.</span> The ceremony at T<i>s</i>&#x12d;nlí (Chinlee Valley) was to celebrate the nubility of Estsánatlehi. Although already
a mother, she was such miraculously, and not until this time did she show signs of
nubility. Such a ceremony is performed for every Navaho maiden now. The ceremony at
San Francisco Mountain occurred four days after that at T<i>s</i>&#x12d;nlí. It is now the custom among the Navahoes to hold a second ceremony over a maiden
four days after the first. On the second ceremony with Estsánatlehi they laid her
on top of the mountain with her head to the west, because she was to go to the west
to dwell there. They manipulated her body and stretched out her limbs. Thus she bade
the people do, in future, to all Navaho maidens, and thus the Navahoes do now, in
the ceremony of the fourth day, when they try to mould the body of the maiden to look
like the perfect form of Estsánatlehi. Version A makes the nubile ceremony occur before
the child was born.

<p id="not163"><span class="parNum">163.</span> <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;-y&#x115;&#x2032;t-li (Meeting Waters) is the junction of two important rivers somewhere in the

</p>
<p id="not164"><span class="parNum">164.</span> The following appeared in the &#x201c;American Naturalist&#x201d; for February, 1887:&#x2014;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;In the interesting account entitled &#x2018;Some Deities and Demons of the Navajos,&#x2019; by
Dr. W. Matthews, in the October issue of the &#x201c;Naturalist&#x201d; (<a href="#not306">note 306</a>), he mentions the fact that the warriors offered their sacrifices at the sacred shrine
of Thoyetli, in the San Juan Valley. He says that the Navajos have a tradition that
the gods of war, or sacred brothers, still dwell at Thoyetli, and their reflection
is sometimes seen on the San Juan River. Dr. Matthews is certain the last part is
due to some natural phenomenon. The following account seems to furnish a complete
explanation of this part of the myth. Several years ago a clergyman, while travelling
in the San Juan Valley, noticed a curious phenomenon while gazing down upon the San
Juan River as it flowed through a deep canyon. Mists began to arise, and soon he saw
the shadows of himself and companions reflected near the surface of the river, and
surrounded by a circular rainbow, the &#x2018;Circle of Ulloa.&#x2019; They jumped, moved away,
and performed a number of exercises, to be certain that the figures were their reflections,
and the figures responded. There was but slight color in the rainbow. Similar reflections
have no doubt caused the superstitious Indians to consider these reflections as those
of their deities.&#x201d;&#x2014;G.&nbsp;A. Brennan, Roseland, Cook County, Illinois, January 12, 1887.
</p>
<p id="not165"><span class="parNum">165.</span> Tse&#x2bb;-gí-hi is the name of some canyon, abounding in cliff-dwellings, north of the
San Juan River, in Colorado or Utah. The author knows of it only from description.
It is probably the McElmo or the Mancos Canyon. It is supposed by the Navahoes to
have been a favorite home of the yéi or gods, and the ruined cliff-houses are supposed
to have been inhabited by the divine ones. The cliff ruins in the Chelly Canyon, Arizona,
are also supposed to have been homes of the gods; in fact, the gods are still thought
to dwell there unseen. Chelly is but a Spanish orthography of the Navaho name Tsé&#x2bb;gi,
Tséyi or T<i>s</i>éyi. When a Navaho would say &#x201c;in the Chelly Canyon,&#x201d; he says Tséyigi. The resemblance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>of this expression to Tse&#x2bb;gíhi (g and y being interchangeable) led the author at first
to confound the two places. Careful inquiry showed that different localities were
meant. Both names have much the same meaning (Among the Cliffs, or Among the Rocks).
</p>
<p id="not166"><span class="parNum">166.</span> The expression used by the story-teller was, &#x201c;seven times old age has killed.&#x201d; This
would be freely translated by most Navaho-speaking whites as &#x201c;seven ages of old men.&#x201d;
The length of the age of an old man as a period of time is variously estimated by
the Navahoes. Some say it is a definite cycle of 102 years,&#x2014;the same number as the
counters used in the game of kesit<i>s</i>é (<a href="#not176">note 176</a>); others say it is &#x201c;threescore years and ten;&#x201d; while others, again, declare it to
be an indefinite period marked by the death of some very old man in the tribe. This
Indian estimate would give, for the existence of the nuclear gens of the Navaho nation,
a period of from five hundred to seven hundred years. In his excellent paper on the
&#x201c;Early Navajo and Apache,&#x201d;<a href="#not301" class="noteref">301</a> Mr. F.&nbsp;W. Hodge arrives at a much later date for the creation or first mention of
the Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni by computing the dates given in this legend, and collating the same with the
known dates of Spanish-American history. He shows that many of the dates given in
this story are approximately correct. While the Tse&#x2bb;d<i>z</i>&#x12d;nk&#x12d;&#x2032;ni is, legendarily, the nuclear gens of the Navahoes, it does not follow, even
from the legend, that it is the oldest gens; for the <i>d</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; <i>d</i>&#x12d;gíni, or holy people (see note <a href="#not92">92</a>), are supposed to have existed before it was created.
</p>
<p id="not167"><span class="parNum">167.</span> Tse&#x2bb;-d<i>z</i>&#x12d;n-k&#x12d;&#x2032;n-i is derived from tse&#x2bb; (rock), d<i>z</i>&#x12d;n (black, dark), and kin (a straight-walled house, a stone or adobe house, not a
Navaho hut or <i>h</i>o<i>g</i>án). Tse&#x2bb; is here rendered &#x201c;cliffs,&#x201d; because the house or houses in question are described
as situated in dark cliffs. Like nearly all other Navaho gentile names, it seems to
be of local origin.
</p>
<p id="not168"><span class="parNum">168.</span> The rock formations of Arizona and New Mexico are often so fantastic that such a
condition as that here described might easily occur.
</p>
<p id="not169"><span class="parNum">169.</span> The author has expressed the opinion elsewhere<a href="#not318" class="noteref">318</a> that we need not suppose from this passage that the story-teller wishes to commiserate
the Tse&#x2bb;tláni on the inferiority of their diet; he may merely intend to show that
his gens had not the same taboo as the elder gentes. The modern Navahoes do not eat
ducks or snakes. Taboo is perhaps again alluded to in <a href="#par394">par. 394</a>, where it is said that the <i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha ate ducks and fish. The Navahoes do not eat fish, and fear fish in many ways.
A white woman, for mischief, emptied over a young Navaho man a pan of water in which
fish had been soaked. He changed all his clothes and purified himself by bathing.
Navahoes have been known to refuse candies that were shaped like fish.
</p>
<p id="not170"><span class="parNum">170.</span> A common method of killing deer and antelope in the old days was this: They were
driven on to some high, steep-sided, jutting mesa, whose connection with the neighboring
plateau was narrow and easily guarded. Here their retreat was cut off, and they were

<p id="not171"><span class="parNum">171.</span> The name <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;-<i>d</i>o-kó<i>n</i>-<i>z</i>i is derived from two words,&#x2014;<i>t</i>o&#x2bb; (water) and <i>d</i>okó<i>n</i><i>z</i> (here translated saline). The latter word is used to denote a distinct but not an
unpleasant taste. It has synonyms in other Indian languages, but not in English. It
is known only from explanation that the water in question had a pleasant saline taste.

<p id="not172"><span class="parNum">172.</span> The arrow-case of those days is a matter of tradition only. The Indians say it looked
something like a modern shawl-strap.

<p id="not173"><span class="parNum">173.</span> In the name of this gens we have possibly another evidence of a former existence
of totemism among some of the Navaho gentes. <i>H</i>a<i>s</i>kán<i>h</i>atso may mean that many people of the Yucca gens lived in the land, and not that many
yuccas grew there.

<p id="not174"><span class="parNum">174.</span> From the description given of this tree, which, the Indians say, still stands, it

<p id="not175"><span class="parNum">175.</span> Ts&#x12d;n-a-d<i>z</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;-ni is derived by double syncopation from ts&#x12d;n (wood), na (horizontal), d<i>z</i>&#x12d;n (dark or black), and the suffix ni. The word for black, d<i>z</i>&#x12d;n, in compounds is often pronounced <i>z</i>&#x12d;n. There is a place called Ts&#x12d;&#x2032;nad<i>z</i>&#x12d;n somewhere in Arizona, but the author has not located it.
</p>
<p id="not176"><span class="parNum">176.</span> K&#x115;-s&#x12d;-t<i>s</i>é, or kesit<i>s</i>é, from ke (moccasins), and sit<i>s</i>é (side by side, in a row), is a game played only during the winter months, at night
and inside of a lodge. A multitude of songs, and a myth of a contest between animals
who hunt by day and those who hunt by night, pertain to the game. Eight moccasins
are buried in the ground (except about an inch of their tops), and they are filled
with earth or sand. They are placed side by side, a few inches apart, in two rows,&#x2014;one
row on each side of the fire. A chip, marked black on one side (to represent night),
is tossed up to see which side should begin first. The people of the lucky side hold
up a screen to conceal their operations, and hide a small stone in the sand in one
of the moccasins. When the screen is lowered, one of the opponents strikes the moccasins
with a stick, and guesses which one contains the stone. If he guesses correctly, his
side takes the stone to hide and the losers give him some counters. If he does not
guess correctly, the first players retain the stone and receive a certain number of
counters. (See note <a href="#not88">88</a>.) A better account of this game, with an epitome of the myth and several of the songs,
has already been published.<a href="#not316" class="noteref">316</a>
</p>
<p id="not177"><span class="parNum">177.</span> There are many allusions in the Navaho tales to the clothing of this people before
the introduction of sheep (which came through the Spanish invaders), and before they
cultivated the art of weaving, which they probably learned from the Pueblo tribes,
although they are now better weavers than the Pueblos. The Navahoes represent themselves
as miserably clad in the old days (<a href="#par466">par. 466</a>), and they tell that many of their arts were learned from other tribes. (<a href="#par393">Par. 393</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not178"><span class="parNum">178.</span> Allusion is here made to the material used by Indians on the backs of bows, for bow-strings,
as sewing-thread, and for many other purposes, which is erroneously called &#x201c;sinew&#x201d;
by ethnographers and travellers. It is not sinew in the anatomical or histological
sense of the word. It is yellow fibrous tissue taken from the dorsal region, probably
the aponeurosis of the trapezius.
</p>
<p id="not179"><span class="parNum">179.</span> The Navaho country abounds in small caves and rock-shelters, some of which have been
walled up by these Indians and used as store-houses (but not as dwellings, for reasons
elsewhere given, <a href="#par26">par. 26</a>). Such store-houses are in use at this day.
</p>
<p id="not180"><span class="parNum">180.</span> The legends represent the Navahoes not only as poorly clad and poorly fed in the
old days, but as possessing few arts. Here and elsewhere in the legends it is stated
that various useful arts became known to the tribe through members of other tribes
adopted by the Navahoes.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">181.</span> Another version states that when the Western immigrants were travelling along the
western base of the Lukachokai Mountains, some wanted to ascend the Tse&#x2bb;&#x12d;nlí<i>n</i> valley; but one woman said, &#x201c;No; let us keep along the base of the mountain.&#x201d; From
this they named her Base of Mountain, and her descendants bear that name now. This
explanation is less likely than that in <a href="#par393">par. 393</a>.
</p>
<p id="not182"><span class="parNum">182.</span> This statement should be accepted only with some allowance for the fact that it was
made by one who was of the gens of <span class="corr" id="xd29e14345" title="Source: Thá&#x2bb;paha"><i>T</i><i>h</i>á&#x2bb;paha</span>.
</p>
<p id="not183"><span class="parNum">183.</span> Punishments for adultery were various and severe among many Indian tribes in former
days. Early travellers mention amputation of the nose and other mutilations, and it
appears that capital punishment for this crime was not uncommon. If there is any punishment
for adultery among the Navahoes to-day, more severe than a light whipping, which is
rarely given, the author has never heard of it. The position of the Navaho woman is
such that grievous punishments would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>not be tolerated. In the days of <span class="corr" id="xd29e14360" title="Source: Góntso">Góntso</span> even, it would seem they were scarcely less protected than now, for then the husband,
although a potent chief, did not dare to punish his wives&#x2014;so the legend intimates&#x2014;until
he had received the consent of their relatives.
</p>
<p id="not184"><span class="parNum">184.</span> For the performance of these nine-days&#x2019; ceremonies the Navahoes now build temporary
medicine-lodges, which they use, as a rule, for one occasion only. Rarely is a ceremony
performed twice in the same place, and there is no set day, as indicated by any phase
of any particular lunation, for the beginning of any great ceremony. Many ceremonies
may be performed only during the cold months, but otherwise the time for performance
is not defined. There is a tradition that their customs were different when they lived
in a compact settlement on the banks of the San Juan River (before they became shepherds
and scattered over the land); that they then had permanent medicine-lodges, and exact
dates for the performance of some ceremonies. In <a href="#par411">paragraph 411</a> we hear of a ceremony which lasted all winter.
</p>
<p id="not185"><span class="parNum">185.</span> For a description of this ceremony see &#x201c;The Mountain Chant: a Navaho Ceremony,&#x201d;<a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a> by the author. It is an important healing ceremony of nine days&#x2019; duration. The rites,
until the last night, are held in the medicine-lodge and are secret. Just after sunset
on the last day, a great round corral, or circle of evergreen branches, is constructed,
called i<i>l</i>násd<i>z</i>&#x12d;n, or the dark circle of branches. This is about forty paces in diameter, about eight
feet high, with an opening in the east about ten feet wide. From about eight <span class="asc">P.M.</span> on the last night of the ceremony until dawn next morning, a number of dances, dramatic
shows, medicine rites, and tricks of legerdemain are performed in this corral, in
the presence of a large group of spectators,&#x2014;several hundred men, women, and children.
No one is refused admittance. <a href="#fig37">Fig. 37</a> shows the dark circle of branches as it appears at sunrise when the rites are over,
and, in addition to the original opening in the east, three other openings have been
made in the circle. <a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a> shows the alíl (rite, show, or ceremony) of nahikáï, which takes place on this occasion,
and it is designed largely for the entertainment and mystification of the spectators.
The performers march around (and very close to) the great central fire, which emits
an intense heat. Their skin would probably be scorched if it were not heavily daubed
with white earth. Each actor carries a short wand, at the tip of which is a ball of
eagle-down. This ball he must burn off in the fire, and then, by a simple sleight-of-hand
trick, seem to restore the ball again to the end of his wand. When this is accomplished,
he rushes out of the corral, trumpeting like a sand-hill crane. In &#x201c;The Mountain Chant&#x201d;
this is called a dance, but the movements of the actors are not in time to music.
Nahikáï signifies &#x201c;it becomes white again,&#x201d; and refers to the reappearance of the
eagle-down. The show is very picturesque, and must be mystifying to simple minds.
</p>
<p id="not186"><span class="parNum">186.</span> Tse&#x2bb;-<i>z</i>&#x12d;n-<i>d</i>i-aí signifies Black Rock Standing (like a wall). It might mean an artificial wall
of black rock; but as the result of careful inquiry it has been learned that the name
refers to a locality where exists the formation known to geologists as trap-dyke.
It cannot be averred that it is applied to all trap-dyke.
</p>
<p id="not187"><span class="parNum">187.</span> Slaves were numerous among the Navahoes, and slavery was openly recognized by them
until 1883, when the just and energetic agent, Mr. D.&nbsp;M. Riordan, did much to abolish
it. Yet as late as 1893, when the writer was last in the Navaho country, he found
evidence that the institution still existed, though very occultly, and to a more limited
extent than formerly.
</p>
<p id="not188"><span class="parNum">188.</span> Some translate <i>H</i>áltso as Yellow Valley, and give a different myth to account for the name. As most
Navaho gentile names are undoubtedly of local origin, there may be a tendency to make
all gentile names accord with the general rule.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p id="not189"><span class="parNum">189.</span> The word here translated pet (<i>l</i>i<i>n</i>) means also a domestic animal and a personal <span class="corr" id="xd29e14422" title="Source: fetich">fetish</span>. (See <a href="#par63">par. 63</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not190"><span class="parNum">190.</span> Although this name, B&#x12d;-<i>t</i>á&#x2bb;-ni, seems so much like that of B&#x12d;<i>t</i>áni that one might think they were but variants of the same word, they are undoubtedly
distinct names and must not be confounded.
</p>
<p id="not191"><span class="parNum">191.</span> This is believed to be the notable landmark called by the whites Sunset Peak, which
is about ten miles east of San Francisco Peak, in Yavapai County, Arizona. Sunset
Peak is covered with dark forests nearly to its summit. The top is of brilliant red
rock capped by a paler stratum, and it has the appearance, at all hours of the day,
of being lighted by the setting sun.
</p>
<p id="not192"><span class="parNum">192.</span> This locality is in Apache County, Arizona, about sixty miles from the eastern boundary
and twelve miles from the northern boundary of the Territory. A sharp volcanic peak,
6,825 feet high above sea-level, which marks the place from afar, is called &#x201c;Agathla
Needle&#x201d; on the maps of the United States Geological Survey, and on the accompanying
map, which was compiled from the government maps by Mr. Frank Tweedy of the Geological
Survey.
</p>
<p id="not193"><span class="parNum">193.</span> The Navahoes are aware that in lands far to the north there are kindred tribes which
speak languages much like their own. They have traditions that long ago some of their
number travelled in search of these tribes and found them. These distant kinsmen are
called by the Navaho <i>D</i>&#x12d;né&#x2bb; Na<i>h</i>otlóni, or Navahoes in Another Place.
</p>
<p id="not194"><span class="parNum">194.</span> A version has been recorded which says that, on the march, one woman loitered behind
at Deer Spring for a while, as if loath to leave; that for this reason they called
her Deer Spring, and that her descendants became the gens of that name. The same version
accounts in a similar manner for the names given at the magic fountains. The women
did not call out the names of the springs, but they loitered at them.
</p>
<p id="not195"><span class="parNum">195.</span> The story of the Deer Spring People affords, perhaps, the best evidence in favor
of the former existence of totemism to be found in the legend. Assuming that the immigrants
from the west had once totemic names, we may explain this story by saying that it
was people of the Deer gens who stayed behind and gave their name to the spring where
they remained; that in the course of time they became known as People of the Deer
Spring; and that, as they still retain their old name in a changed form, the story-teller
is constrained to say that the fate of the deer is not known. Perhaps the name of
the Mai<i>t</i>ó&#x2bb;<i>d</i>&#x12d;ne&#x2bb; (<a href="#par428">par. 428</a>) may be explained in somewhat the same way. (See &#x201c;The Gentile System of the Navajo
Indians,&#x201d; p. 107.<a href="#not318" class="noteref">318</a>)
</p>
<p id="not196"><span class="parNum">196.</span> The more proper interpretation of <i>H</i>o-na-gá&#x2bb;-ni seems to be People of the Walking Place, from <i>h</i>o (locative), nága (to walk), and ni (people). It is not unreasonable to suppose that,
like nearly all other Navaho gentile names, this name has a local meaning, and that
the story here told to account for its origin is altogether mythical.
</p>
<p id="not197"><span class="parNum">197.</span> This episode indicates that kindness and pity are sentiments not unknown to the Navahoes,
and that (though there are many thieves) there are honest men and women among them.
</p>
<p id="not198"><span class="parNum">198.</span> Na-na<i>s</i>-<i>t</i>&#x115;&#x2032;-<i>z</i>i<i>n</i>, the Navaho name for the Zuñi Indians, is said to be derived from aná (an alien or
an enemy), nas<i>t</i>e (a horizontal stripe), and <i>z</i>&#x12d;n (black). Some say it refers to the way the Zuñians cut their hair,&#x2014;&#x201c;bang&#x201d; it,&#x2014;straight
across the forehead; others say it is the name of a locality.
</p>
<p id="not199"><span class="parNum">199.</span> Ki<i>n</i>-a-á&#x2bb;-ni, or Ki<i>n</i>-ya-á&#x2bb;-ni, means People of the High Pueblo House,&#x2014;the high wall of stone or adobe.
The name ki<i>n</i>aá&#x2bb; might with propriety be applied to any one of hundreds of ruins in the Navaho
country, but the only one to which the name is known to be given is a massive ruin
six or seven stories high <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>in Bernalillo County, New Mexico, about seventeen miles in a northerly direction from
Chaves Station, on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. This ruin consists of unusually
large fragments of stone, and looks more like a ruined European castle than other
old Indian dwellings. It seems too far east and south, and too far away from the settlements
on the San Juan, where the western immigrants finished their journey, to be the place,
as some say it is, from which the gens of Ki<i>n</i>aá&#x2bb;ni derived its name. The high stone wall which the immigrants passed en route,
mentioned in <a href="#par435">par. 435</a> in connection with the gens of Ki<i>n</i>aá&#x2bb;ni, may be the place to which the legend originally ascribed the origin of the
name. There are many pueblo remains around San Francisco Mountain. The name is written
&#x201c;Kin-ya-a-ni&#x201d; on the accompanying map.
</p>
<p id="not200"><span class="parNum">200.</span> <a href="#plate1">Plate I.</a>, fig. 1, shows a yébaad, or female yéi or goddess, as she is usually represented
in the dry-paintings. The following objects are here indicated: (1) A square mask
or domino, which covers the face only (see <a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>), is painted blue, margined below with yellow (to represent the yellow evening light),
and elsewhere with lines of red and black (for hair above, for ears at the sides),
and has downy eagle-feathers on top, tied on with white strings; (2) a robe of white,
extending from the armpits to near the knees, adorned with red and blue to represent
sunbeams, and fringed beautifully at the bottom; (3) white leggings secured with colored
garters (such as Indians weave); (4) embroidered moccasins; (5) an ornamental sash;
(6) a wand of spruce-twigs in each hand (sometimes she is shown with spruce in one
hand and a seed-basket in the other); (7) jewels&#x2014;ear-pendants, bracelets, and necklaces&#x2014;of
turquoise and coral; (8) long strips of fox-skin ornamented at the ends, which hang
from wrists and elbows. (For explanation of blue neck, see note <a href="#not74">74</a>.) In the dance of the nahikáï, there are properly six yébaad in masquerade; but sometimes
they have to get along with a less number, owing to the difficulty in finding suitable
persons enough to fill the part. The actors are usually low-sized men and boys, who
must contrast in appearance with those who enact the part of males. Each yébaad actor
wears no clothing except moccasins and a skirt, which is held on with a silver-studded
belt; his body and limbs are painted white; his hair is unbound and hangs over his
shoulders; he wears the square female mask and he carries in each hand a bundle of
spruce twigs, which is so secured, by means of strings, that he cannot carelessly
let it fall. Occasionally females are found to dance in this character: these have
their bodies fully clothed in ordinary woman&#x2019;s attire; but they wear the masks and
carry the wands just as the young men do. While the male gods, in <a href="#plate1">plate I.</a>, except Dsaha<i>d</i>old<i>z</i>á, are represented with white arms, the female is depicted with yellow arms. This
symbolism is explained in note <a href="#not27">27</a>.
</p>
<p id="not201"><span class="parNum">201.</span> The exact etymology of the word Na-<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n-&#x115;s-<i>t</i><i>h</i>a-ni has not been determined. The idea it conveys is: He who teaches himself, he who
discovers for himself, or he who thinks out a problem for himself. We find the verb
in the expression nas&#x12d;ní<i>t</i>in, which means, &#x201c;Teach me how to do it.&#x201d; Here the second and third syllables are
pronouns. Although the hero has his name changed after a while, the story-teller usually
continues to call him Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani to the end of the story. Often he speaks of him as the man or the Navaho.

<p id="not202"><span class="parNum">202.</span> The eighteen articles here referred to are as follows: 1, white shell; 2, turquoise;
3, haliotis shell; 4, pás<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni or cannel coal; 5, red stone; 6, feathers of the yellow warbler; 7, feathers of

(See <a href="#not13">note 13</a>.) These were the sacred articles which the gods were said to require in the myths
of kléd<i>z</i>i <span class="corr" id="xd29e14581" title="Source: hatál"><i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i></span> and atsósid<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>. In the myths of the former rite they are mentioned over and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>over again, to the weariness of the hearer. They are all used to-day in the rites
mentioned, except the five baskets. Now ordinary sacred baskets (note <a href="#not5">5</a>, <a href="#par28">par. 28</a>) are used; the jeweled baskets are legendary only.
</p>
<p id="not203"><span class="parNum">203.</span> The knowledge of domestic or pet turkeys is not new to the Navahoes. The Pueblo Indians
of the Southwest have kept them for centuries. The Navahoes declare that in former
years they kept pet turkeys themselves; but this seems doubtful, considering their
mode of life. A conservative Navaho will not now eat turkey flesh, although he will
not hesitate to shoot a wild turkey to sell it to a white man.
</p>
<p id="not204"><span class="parNum">204.</span> In the Navaho dry-paintings the rainbow is usually depicted with a head at one end
and legs and feet at the other. The head is represented with a square mask to show
that it is a goddess. It is apotheosized. (See <a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>.) In one of the dry-paintings of the mountain chant the rainbow is depicted without
limbs or head, but terminating at one end with five eagle-plumes, at the other end
with five magpie-plumes, and decorated near its middle with plumes of the bluebird
and the red-shafted woodpecker. (See &#x201c;The Mountain Chant,&#x201d; p. 450.<a href="#not314" class="noteref">314</a>)
</p>
<p id="not205"><span class="parNum">205.</span> This magic cup figures in many other Navaho myths. (See <a href="#par572">paragraph 572</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not206"><span class="parNum">206.</span> <i>H</i>as-t<i>s</i>é-ol-<i>t</i>o-i means the Shooting <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é (<a href="#par78">par. 78</a>), or Shooting Deity. As the personator of this character always wears a female mask
(<a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>), it would seem that this divinity of the chase, like the Roman Diana, is a goddess.
The personator (a man) carries a quiver of puma skin, a bow, and two arrows. The latter
are made of reed, are headless, and are feathered with the tail and wing feathers
of the red-tailed buzzard (<i lang="la">Buteo borealis</i>), tied on with fibrous tissue. The tips of the arrows are covered with moistened
white earth and moistened pollen. Each arrow is at least two spans and a hand&#x2019;s-breadth
long; but it must be cut off three finger-widths beyond a node, and to accomplish
this it may be made a little longer than the above dimensions. There are very particular
rules about applying the feathers. The man who personates <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éol<i>t</i>oi, in a rite of succor in the ceremony of the night chant, follows the personators
of the War Gods. While the patient stands on a buffalo robe in front of the medicine-lodge,
the actor waves with the right hand one arrow at him, giving a peculiar call; then,
changing the arrows from one hand to another, he waves the other arrow at the patient.
This is done east, south, west, and north. The actor repeats these motions around
the lodge; all then enter the lodge; there the patient says a prayer, and, with many
formalities, presents a cigarette to the personator (after he has prayed and sacrificed
to the War Gods). The three masqueraders then go to the west of the lodge to deposit
their sacrifices (that of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éol<i>t</i>oi is put under a weed,&#x2014;<i lang="la">Gutierrezia euthamiæ</i>, if possible). When this is done, they take off their masks, don ordinary blankets,&#x2014;brought
out by an accomplice,&#x2014;hide the masks under their blankets, and return to the lodge
in the guise of ordinary Indians. Some speak as if there were but one <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éol<i>t</i>oi, and say she is the wife of Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni. Others speak as if there were one at
every place where the yéi have homes.
</p>
<p id="not207"><span class="parNum">207.</span> The Gá<i>n</i>-as-k&#x12d;-<i>d</i>i are a numerous race of divinities. Their chief home is at a place called <i>D</i>epé<i>h</i>a<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>i<i>l</i> (Tries to Shoot Sheep), near Tse&#x2bb;gíhi, north of the San Juan; but they may appear
anywhere, and, according to the myths, are often found in company with the yéi and
other gods. They belong to the Mountain Sheep People, and often appear to man in the
form of Rocky Mountain sheep. In the myths of the night chant it is said that they
captured the prophet of the rites, took him to their home, and taught him many of
the mysteries of the night chant. In the treatment accompanying these, the tendo-achillis
of a mountain sheep is applied to an aching limb to relieve pain; the horn is pressed
to an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>aching head to relieve headache; and water from the sheep&#x2019;s eye is used for sore eyes.
The Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i are gods of plenty and harvest gods. A masquerader, representing one of these, sometimes
appears in an act of succor about sundown on the last day of the night chant, following
representatives of <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éyal<i>t</i>i and Dsaha<i>d</i>old<i>z</i>á. He wears the ordinary blue mask of a yébaka with the fringe of hair removed. He
carries a crown or headdress made of a basket from which the bottom has been cut,
so that it may fit on the head. The basket crown is adorned with artificial horns;
it is painted on the lower surface black, with a zigzag streak to represent lightning
playing on the face of a black cloud; it is painted red on the upper surface (not
shown in picture), to indicate the sunlight on the other side of the cloud; and it
is decorated with radiating feathers, from the tail of the red-shafted woodpecker
(<i lang="la">Colaptes mexicanus</i>), to represent the rays of the sun streaming out at the edge of the cloud. The god
is crowned with the storm-cloud. The horns on the crown are made of the skin of the
Rocky Mountain sheep (sewed with yucca fibre); they are stuffed with hair of the same,
or with black wool; they are painted part black and part blue, with white markings;
and they are tipped with eagle-feathers tied on with white string. On his back the
actor carries a long bag of buckskin, which is empty, but is kept distended by means
of a light frame made of the twigs of aromatic sumac, so as to appear full; it is
decorated at the back with eagle-plumes, and sometimes also with the plumes of the
red-shafted woodpecker; it is painted on the sides with short parallel white lines
(12 or 16), and at the back with long lines of four colors. This bag represents a
bag of black cloud, filled with produce of the fields, which the god is said to carry.
The cloudy bag is so heavy, they say, that the god is obliged to lean on a staff,
bend his back, and walk as one bearing a burden; so the personator does the same.
The staff, or g&#x12d;<i>s</i>, which the latter carries, is made of cherry (new for each occasion); it is as long
as from the middle of the left breast to the tip of the outstretched right hand; it
is painted black with the charcoal of four sacred plants; it bears a zigzag stripe
in white to represent lightning, and it is trimmed with many turkey-feathers in two
whorls, and one eagle-feather. These properties and adornments are conventionally
represented in the dry-paintings. (See <a href="#plate1">plate I.</a>, fig. 5.) The red powder thinly sprinkled over the eagle-plumes at the back represents
pollen. The cloud bag is tied on the god, says the myth, with rainbows. The yellow
horizontal line at the chin in the picture represents a yellow line on the mask which
symbolizes the evening twilight. The actor wears a collar of fox-skin (indicated by
mark under right ear) and ordinary clothing. The elaborate ceremony of succor will
not be described here. Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i means Humpback. The name is sometimes given Ná<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i.

<p id="not208"><span class="parNum">208.</span> The only K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>l</i>&#x12d;z, or K&#x12d;&#x2032;n<i>d</i>o<i>t</i>l&#x12d;z (Blue House), the writer knows of is a ruined pueblo of that name in the Chaco
Canyon; but this can hardly be the Blue House referred to in the myth. There is probably
another ruin of this name on the banks of the San Juan.
</p>
<p id="not209"><span class="parNum">209.</span> The Dsaha<i>d</i>old<i>z</i>á, or Fringe-mouths, are a class of divine beings of whom little information has been
gained. They are represented in the rite of kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> by sand-paintings, and by masqueraders decked and masked as shown in the pictures.
There are two kinds,&#x2014;Fringe-mouths of the land and Fringe-mouths of the water (<a href="#plate1">plate I.</a>, fig. 3), or <i>T</i><i>h</i>astlát<i>s</i>i Dsaha<i>d</i>old<i>z</i>á; the latter are the class referred to in this story. The zigzag lines on their bodies
shown in the pictures represent the crooked lightning, which they used as ropes to
lift the log. On the mask (shown in the dry-painting) the mouth is surrounded by white
radiating lines; hence the name Fringe-mouths. The actor who represents the Fringe-mouths
of the land has one half of his body and one half of his mask painted black, the other
half red. He who represents the Fringe-mouths of the water <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>has his body painted half blue and half yellow, as shown in <a href="#plate1">plate I.</a>, fig. 3. Both wear a similar mask and a similar crown or headdress. The crown consists
of a basket from which the bottom has been cut, so that it may fit on the head; the
lower surface is painted black, to represent a dark cloud, and is streaked with white
to represent lightning; the upper surface (not shown in the painting) is colored red,
to represent the sunlight of the back of the cloud; and feathers of the red-shafted
woodpecker are attached to the edge, to represent sunbeams. So far, this crown is
like that worn by Gá<i>n</i>ask&#x12d;<i>d</i>i (note <a href="#not207">207</a>). Ascending from the basket crown is a tripod of twigs of aromatic sumac, painted
white; between the limbs of the tripod finely combed red wool is laid, and a downy
eagle-feather tips each stick. The actor carries in his left hand a bow adorned with
three eagle-plumes and two tufts of turkey feathers, and in his right hand a white
gourd rattle, sometimes decorated with two whorls of feathers. His torso, arms, and
legs are naked, but painted. He wears a shirt around his loins, and rich necklaces
and ear pendants. All these things are plainly indicated in the dry-paintings. The
fox-skin collar which he wears is vaguely shown by an appendage at the right ear.
The angles of the white lightning on the chest and limbs of the actor are not as numerous
as in the paintings.

<p id="not210"><span class="parNum">210.</span> Tie<i>l</i>í<i>n</i> are ferocious pets that belong to Tiéholtsodi, the water monster, and guard the door

<p id="not212"><span class="parNum">212.</span> <i>H</i>as-t<i>s</i>é-<i>z</i>&#x12d;n-i signifies Black <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é, or Black God. There are several of them (dwelling at Tsení&#x2bb;<i>h</i>o<i>d</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>y&#x12d;<i>l</i>, near Tse&#x2bb;gíhi), but the description will be given in the singular. He is a reserved,
exclusive individual. The yéi at other places do not visit him whenever they wish.
He owns all fire; he was the first who made fire, and he is the inventor of the fire-drill.
It is only on rare occasions that he is represented by a masquerader at a ceremony.
When it is arranged to give a night chant without the public dance of the last night
(and this seldom occurs), Black God appears in a scene of succor<a href="#not206" class="noteref">206</a> on the evening of the ninth day in company with three other gods,&#x2014;Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni, and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éol<i>t</i>oi. It is said that the personator is dressed in black clothes; wears a black mask,
with white marks and red hair on it, and a collar of fox-skin; and that he carries
a fire-drill and a bundle of cedar-bark. The author has never seen <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é<i>z</i>&#x12d;ni represented either in a dry-painting or in masquerade, and he has therefore never
witnessed the scene or ceremony of succor referred to. This ceremony, which is very
elaborate, has been described to the author by the medicine-men. The actor has to
be well paid for his tedious services, which occupy the whole day from sunrise to
sunset, though the act of succor lasts but a few minutes.
</p>
<p id="not213"><span class="parNum">213.</span> The fire-drill is very little used by the Navahoes at the present time,&#x2014;matches and
flint-and-steel having taken its place; but it is frequently mentioned in the myths
and is employed in the ceremonies. Of the many aboriginal fire-drills, described and
depicted by Dr. Walter Hough in his excellent paper on &#x201c;Fire-making Apparatus,&#x201d;<a href="#not302" class="noteref">302</a> that of the Navahoes is the rudest. It looks like a thing that had been made to order.
</p>
<p id="not214"><span class="parNum">214.</span> Ts&#x12d;n-tl&#x12d;&#x2032;-zi signifies hard, brittle wood.
</p>
<p id="not215"><span class="parNum">215.</span> It is probable that the various peculiar acts described in this paragraph have reference
to agricultural rites still practised, or recently practised, by the Navahoes, but
the writer has never witnessed such rites.
</p>
<p id="not216"><span class="parNum">216.</span> The Navahoes now universally smoke cigarettes, but they say that in ancient days
they smoked pipes made of terra-cotta. Fragments of such pipes are often picked up
in New Mexico and Arizona. The cliff-dwellers also had pipes, and these articles are
still ceremonially used by the Mokis. The Navahoes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>now invariably, in ceremonies, sacrifice tobacco in the form of cigarettes. But cigarettes
are not new to the Southwest: they are found in ancient caves and other long-neglected
places in New Mexico and Arizona.
</p>
<p id="not217"><span class="parNum">217.</span> Ni-no-ká-<i>d</i>&#x12d;-ne&#x2bb; (People up on the Earth) may mean people living up on the mountains, in contradistinction
to those dwelling in canyons and valleys; but other tribes use a term of similar meaning
to distinguish the whole Indian race from the whites or other races, and it is probable
that it is used in this sense here and in other Navaho myths. The people whom Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani now meets are probably supposed to be supernatural, and not Indians.
</p>
<p id="not218"><span class="parNum">218.</span> The plants mixed with the tobacco were these: t<i>s</i>ohod<i>z</i>&#x12d;laí&#x2bb;, <i>s</i>ilátso (my thumb), a poisonous weed, azébini&#x2bb;, and azétloi. It has not been determined
what plants these are; but the Navaho names are placed on record as possibly assisting
in future identification.
</p>
<p id="not219"><span class="parNum">219.</span> In the Navaho ceremonies, when sacred cigarettes are finished, and before they are
deposited as offerings to the gods, they are symbolically lighted with sunbeams. (See
<a href="#par94">par. 94</a>.) The statement made here, that the hero lighted his pipe with the sun, refers probably
to this symbolic lighting.
</p>
<p id="not220"><span class="parNum">220.</span> K&#x115;&#x2032;tlo is a name given to any medicine used externally, <i>i.e.</i>, rubbed on the body. Atsósi k&#x115;&#x2032;tlo means the liniment or wash of the atsósi <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or feather ceremony. It is also called atsósi azé (feather medicine), and atsósi
t<i>s</i>í<i>l</i> (feather herbs).
</p>
<p id="not221"><span class="parNum">221.</span> Yá-<i>d</i>i-<i>d</i>&#x12d;-ni<i>l</i>, the incense of the Navaho priests, is a very composite substance. In certain parts
of the healing ceremonies it is scattered on hot coals, which are placed before the
patient, and the latter inhales actively the dense white fumes that arise. These fumes,
which fill with their odor the whole medicine-lodge, are pungent, aromatic, and rather
agreeable, although the mixture is said to contain feathers. The author has obtained
a formula for yá<i>d</i>i<i>d</i>&#x12d;ni<i>l</i>, but has not identified the plants that chiefly compose it.
</p>
<p id="not222"><span class="parNum">222.</span> These are the animals he raises and controls, as told in <a href="#par527">par. 527</a>.
</p>
<p id="not223"><span class="parNum">223.</span> The Navahoes say they are acquainted with four kinds of wild tobacco, and use them
in their rites. Of these the author has seen and identified but two. These are <i lang="la">Nicotiana attenuata</i> which is the ds&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>l</i>na&#x323;<i>t</i>o, or mountain tobacco; and <i lang="la">Nicotiana palmeri</i>, which is the <i>d</i>epéna&#x323;<i>t</i>o, or sheep tobacco. <i lang="la">N. attenuata</i> grows widely but not abundantly in the mountains of New Mexico and Arizona. <i lang="la">N. palmeri</i> is rare; the writer has seen it growing only in one spot in the Chelly Canyon. It
has not been learned what species are called weasel tobacco and cloud tobacco; but
one or more of the three species, <i lang="la">N. rustica</i>, <i lang="la">N. quadrivalvis</i>, and <i lang="la">N. trigonophylla</i>, are probably known to the Navahoes.
</p>
<p id="not224"><span class="parNum">224.</span> The description of these diseases given by the narrator of this tale is as follows:
&#x201c;Patients having these diseases are weak, stagger, and lose appetite; then they go
to a sweat-house and take an emetic. If they have <i>l</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;tso, or the yellow disease, they vomit something yellow (bile ?). If they have <i>t</i>&#x12d;<i>l</i>-<i>l</i>itá, or cooked blood disease, they vomit something like cooked blood. Those having
the yellows have often yellow eyes and yellow skin. <i>T</i><i>h</i>a<i>t</i>l&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>t</i>, or slime disease, comes from drinking foul water full of green slime or little fish
(tadpoles ?). T<i>s</i>ox<i>s</i>, worms, usually come from eating worms, which you sometimes do without knowing it;
but ts&#x12d;&#x2032;lgo, tapeworm, comes from eating parched corn.&#x201d; Probably the last notion arises
from the slight resemblance of the joints of <i lang="la">Tænia solium</i> to grains of corn. This little chapter in pathology from <span class="corr" id="xd29e15000" title="Source: Hatáli"><i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i</span> Natlói is hardly in accordance with the prevalent theory that savages regard all
disease as of demoniac origin.
</p>
<p id="not225"><span class="parNum">225.</span> The adjective ya<i>z</i>óni, or ya<i>s</i>óni, here used, which is translated &#x201c;beautiful,&#x201d; means more than this: it means both
good (or useful) and beautiful. It contains <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>elements of the words ya<i>t</i>í&#x2bb;, good, and of &#x12d;n<i>z</i>óni, n&#x12d;<i>z</i>óni, and <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni, which signify beautiful.
</p>
<p id="not226"><span class="parNum">226.</span> According to the Navaho myths and songs, the corn and other products in the gardens
of the yéi or divine ones grow and mature in a very short time. The rapid growth of
the crops in Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani&#x2019;s farm is supposed to result from the divine origin of the seed.
</p>
<p id="not227"><span class="parNum">227.</span> The order in which Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani lays down the ears of corn is the order in which sacrificial cigarettes, kethawns,
and other sacred objects, when colored, are laid down in a straight row. The white,
being the color of the east, has precedence of all and is laid down first. The blue,
the color of the south, comes next, for when we move sunwise (the sacred ceremonial
circuit of the Navahoes) south follows immediately after east. Yellow, the color of
the west, on the same principle, comes third; and black (in this case mixed) comes
fourth. Mixed is properly the coloring of the upper region, and usually follows after
black; but it sometimes takes the place of black. These apparently superfluous particulars
of laying down the corn have a ceremonial or religious significance. In placing sacred
objects ceremonially in a straight row, the operator proceeds southward from his starting-point,
for this approximates the sunwise circuit, and he makes the tip ends point east.
</p>
<p id="not228"><span class="parNum">228.</span> Pí<i>n</i>-i-a<i>z</i> b&#x12d;-tsó (fawn-his-cheese), or fawn-cheese, is a substance found in the abdomen of
the fawn. A similar substance is found in other young mammals. They say it looks like
curds, or cottage cheese, and that it is pleasant to the taste. They eat it raw. The
author has not determined by observation what this substance is. Dr. C. Hart Merriam,
of the Department of Agriculture, suggests that it is the partly digested milk in
the stomach of the fawn, and this is probably the case.
</p>
<p id="not229"><span class="parNum">229.</span> The dish offered to Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani is called by the Navahoes at<i>s</i>ó<i>n</i>, which is here translated &#x201c;pemmican.&#x201d; It consists of dried vension pounded on a stone
and fried in grease.
</p>
<p id="not230"><span class="parNum">230.</span> To make <i>d</i>&#x12d;-tló-gi kle-sán, cut the grain off the ear, grind it to a pulp on a metate, spread
out the embers, lay a number of green corn leaves on them, place the pulp on the leaves,
put other leaves on top of the pulp, rake hot embers over all, and leave it to bake.
</p>
<p id="not231"><span class="parNum">231.</span> <i>D</i>&#x12d;-tló-g&#x12d;n <i>t</i><i>s</i>&#x12d;-d&#x12d;-kó-i is made of a pulp of green corn ground on a metate, like <i>d</i>&#x12d;tlógi klesán. The pulp is encased in husks, which are folded at the ends, and is
then placed between leaves and hot coals to bake.
</p>
<p id="not232"><span class="parNum">232.</span> <i>T</i><i>h</i>á-b&#x12d;-t<i>s</i>a (three-ears) is made also of pulp of green corn. This is placed in folded cones
made of husks; three cones being made of one complete husk, whose leaves are not removed
from their stem. It looks like three ears fastened together, whence the name. It is
boiled in water.
</p>
<p id="not233"><span class="parNum">233.</span> The story-teller said: &#x201c;about as far as from here to Jake&#x2019;s house,&#x201d;&#x2014;a distance which
the writer estimated at 300 yards.
</p>
<p id="not234"><span class="parNum">234.</span> Over the east door, one cigarette, that for the male, was made of mountain mahogany
(tsé&#x2bb;es<i>t</i>agi, <i lang="la">Cercocarpus parvifolius</i>), perforated, painted blue, and marked with four symbols of deer-tracks in yellow;
the other cigarette, that for the female, was made of cliff rose (awétsal, <i lang="la">Cowania mexicana</i>), painted yellow and marked with four symbols of deer-tracks in blue. Over the south
door the cigarette for the male was made of sunflower (&#x12d;n<i>d</i>&#x12d;gíli), painted yellow and dotted with four symbols of antelope-tracks in blue; the
cigarette for the female was made of &#x201c;strong-smelling sunflower&#x201d; (&#x12d;n<i>d</i>&#x12d;gíli n&#x12d;lt<i>s</i>óni, <i lang="la">Verbesina enceloides</i>), painted white and dotted with four symbols of antelope-tracks in black. Over the
west door, the cigarettes were of the same material as those in the east; but one
was painted black with symbols of deer-tracks in blue, and the other was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>painted blue with symbols of deer-tracks in black. At the bottom of the steps, one
of the cigarettes was painted black and dotted with four symbols of fawn-tracks in
yellow; the other was painted yellow and dotted with four symbols of fawn-tracks in
black. The above was written from the description of the narrator. The writer has
never seen such cigarettes; but they are said to be employed in some Navaho ceremonies
at the present time. In this series of cigarettes the colors are not in the usual
order,<a href="#not18" class="noteref">18</a> but there may be a special symbolism for these animals, or the variation may arise
because they are the cigarettes of a wizard and therefore unholy.
</p>
<p id="not235"><span class="parNum">235.</span> When driving game to a party in ambush, the Navahoes often imitate the cry of the
wolf. In this myth the old man is supposed to give the cry, not to drive the bears,
but to make Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani believe that deer are being driven.
</p>
<p id="not236"><span class="parNum">236.</span> The name T<i>s</i>a-na-naí is derived from t<i>s</i>an, which means dung. T<i>s</i>&#x115;&#x2032;-sko-<i>d</i>i means Spread-foot. The narrator said the other bears had names, but he could not
remember them.
</p>
<p id="not237"><span class="parNum">237.</span> &#x201c;He did not even thank his son-in-law&#x201d; is an instance of sarcasm.
</p>
<p id="not238"><span class="parNum">238.</span> The bear is a sacred animal with the Navahoes; for this reason the hero did not skin
the bears or eat their flesh. The old man, being a wizard, might do both.
</p>
<p id="not239"><span class="parNum">239.</span> <i>H</i>á-la-d<i>z</i>&#x12d;-ni? means &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; but it is a jocose expression, used only among intimate
relations, or relations by marriage. In employing this interrogatory the Navaho gave
the old man to understand that he was recognized.
</p>
<p id="not240"><span class="parNum">240.</span> This episode of the twelve bears is the weakest and least artistic in the tale. Moreover,
it details a fifth device on the part of Deer Raiser to kill his son-in-law. Under
ordinary circumstances we should expect but four devices. It seems an interpolation,
by some story-teller less ingenious than he who composed the rest of the tale, introduced
to get the men out together once more, so that, on their way home, the incident of
the burnt moccasins might occur. The latter incident has been previously recorded
by the writer in another connection. (See <a href="#not242">note 242</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not241"><span class="parNum">241.</span> Among the Navahoes, when a person dies, the suffix ni, or ini, is added to his (or
her) name, and thus he is mentioned ever afterwards.
</p>
<p id="not242"><span class="parNum">242.</span> Before the story of Na<i>t</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;n&#x115;s<i>t</i><i>h</i>ani was obtained, the writer had already recorded this tale of the burnt moccasins
in a version of the Origin Legend. In the latter connection it is introduced as one
of the Coyote tales. The mischievous Coyote is made to try this trick on his father-in-law;
but the latter, warned by the Wind, foils the Coyote.
</p>
<p id="not243"><span class="parNum">243.</span> The ridge which he crosses in the east and also those which he crosses later in the
south, west, and north are colored according to the regular order of Navaho symbolism.
</p>
<p id="not244"><span class="parNum">244.</span> The narrator described the bird called ts&#x12d;-das-<i>t</i>ó-i thus: When a man passes by where this bird is sitting, the latter does not fly
off, but sits and looks at the man, moving its head in every direction. It is about
the size of a screech-owl.
</p>
<p id="not245"><span class="parNum">245.</span> It must not be supposed that in this and the following paragraph, when pale-faced
people are mentioned, any allusion is made to Caucasians. The reference is merely
symbolic. White is the color of the east in Navaho symbolism: hence these people in
the east are represented as having pale faces. For similar reasons the man in the
south (<a href="#par551">par. 551</a>) is said to have a blue face, the man in the west (<a href="#par552">par. 552</a>) a yellow face, and the man in the north (<a href="#par553">par. 553</a>) a dark face. (See <a href="#not18">note 18</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not246"><span class="parNum">246.</span> B&#x12d;-<i>z</i>a (his treasure), something he specially values; hence his charm, his amulet, his

the divinities are thought to possess such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>charms. The songs often mention some property of a god which they say is &#x201c;B&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>a-ye<i>d</i>&#x12d;g&#x12d;&#x2032;ngo&#x201d; (The treasure which makes him holy or sacred).

</p>
<p id="not247"><span class="parNum">247.</span> These medicines are still in use among the Navahoes. The medicine made of gall consists
mostly of gall of eagles. If a witch has scattered evil medicine on you, use this.
If there are certain kinds of food that disagree with you, and you still wish to eat
them, use the vomit medicine. Hunters obtain the materials when they go out hunting.
All the totemic animals named (puma, blue fox, yellow fox, wolf, and lynx, see <a href="#par548">par. 548</a>) vomit when they eat too much. So said the narrator.
</p>
<p id="not248"><span class="parNum">248.</span> <i lang="la">Buteo borealis.</i> The tail is described as red (&#x201c;bright chestnut red,&#x201d; Coues) by our ornithologists;
but the Navahoes consider it yellow, and call the bird atsé-<i>l</i>&#x12d;tsói, or yellow-tail.
</p>
<p id="not249"><span class="parNum">249.</span> A-tsó-si-d<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a-<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or a-tsó-si <i>h</i>a-<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> means feather chant or feather ceremony. The following particulars concerning the
ceremony were given by the narrator of the story. Dry-paintings are made on the floor
of the medicine-lodge much like those of the kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, and others are made representing different animals. It is still occasionally celebrated,
but not often, and there are only four priests of the rite living. It lasts nine days,
and it has more stories, songs, and acts than any other Navaho ceremony. A deer dance
was part of the rite in the old days, but it is not practised now. The rite is good
for many things, but especially for deer disease. If you sleep on a dry, undressed
deer-skin or foul one, or if a deer sneezes at you or makes any other marked demonstration
at you, you are in danger of getting the deer disease.

<p id="not250"><span class="parNum">250.</span> Yó-i <i>h</i>a-<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>, or yói-d<i>z</i>e <i>h</i>a-<i>t</i>á<i>l</i> (bead chant), is a nine days&#x2019; ceremony, which is becoming obsolete. The author has
been informed that there is only one priest of the rite remaining; that he learned
it from his father, but that he does not know as much about it as his father did.
</p>
<p id="not251"><span class="parNum">251.</span> The device of setting up forked sticks to assist in locating fires seen by night

through the air before reaching the ground again. The Navahoes believe he could soar

distant bands to join in a ceremony. From this account the following passage is taken:
&#x201c;I &#x2026; went to the north. On my way I met another messenger, who was travelling from
a distant camp to this one to call you all to a dance in a circle of branches of a
different kind from ours. When he learned my errand he tried to prevail on me to return
hither and put off our dance until another day, so that we might attend their ceremony,
and that they might in turn attend ours; but I refused, saying our people were in
haste to complete their dance. Then we exchanged bows and quivers, as a sign to our
people that we had met, and that what we would tell on our return was the truth. You
observe the bow and quiver I have now are not those with which I left this morning.
We parted, and I kept on my way toward the north.&#x201d; In <a href="#par597">par. 597</a> of &#x201c;The Great Shell of K&#x12d;ntyél&#x201d; reference is made to the same identical meeting of
couriers. It is interesting to observe how one legend is made to corroborate the other,&#x2014;each
belonging to a different rite.

indicate that it was somewhat like the many-bladed obsidian weapon of the ancient
Mexicans.
</p>
<p id="not265"><span class="parNum">265.</span> The cliff-ruin known as the White House, in the Chelly Canyon, Arizona, has been
often pictured and described. It is called by the Navahoes Kin-i-na-é-kai, which signifies
Stone House of the White Horizontal Streak (the upper story is painted white). The
name White House is a free translation of this. The Navaho legends abound in references
to it, and represent it as once inhabited by divinities. (See <a href="#par78">par. 78</a> and <a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>.)
</p>
<p id="not266"><span class="parNum">266.</span> <i>H</i>á<i>t</i>-<i>d</i>as-<i>t</i><i>s</i>&#x12d;-<i>s</i>i is a divinity who is not depicted in the dry-paintings, and whose representative
the author has not seen. He appears rarely in the ceremonies and is thus described:
The actor wears an ordinary Navaho costume, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>an ordinary yébaka mask adorned with owl-feathers, but not with eagle-plumes. He carries
on his back an entire yucca plant with the leaves hanging down, and a large ring,
two spans in diameter, made of yucca leaves (to show that he is a great gambler at
nán<i>z</i>o<i>z</i>). He carries a whip of yucca leaves, and goes around among the assembled crowd to
treat the ailing. If a man has lumbago he bends over before the actor and presents
his back to be flagellated; if he has headache he presents his head. When the actor
has whipped the ailing one, he turns away from him and utters a low sound (like the
lowing of a cow). When he can find no more people to whip, he returns to the medicine-lodge
and takes off his mask. The cigarette (which the author has in his possession) appropriate
to this god is painted black, and bears rude figures of the yucca ring and the yucca
plant. It is buried east of the lodge beside a growing yucca. Ten songs are sung when
the cigarette is being made, and a prayer is repeated when the work is done. The yucca
which the actor carries must have a large part of its root-stock over ground. It is
kicked out of the ground,&#x2014;neither pulled nor cut. The principal home of the divinity
is at Tsasitsozsaká<i>d</i> (<i lang="la">Yucca Glauca</i>, <i>Standing</i>), near the Chelly Canyon.

from the official report of the count of 1869, made by the acting agent, Capt. Frank
T. Bennett, U.S.A. Captain Bennett says the count was made on two separate days, October

<p id="not269"><span class="parNum">269.</span> <a href="#plate4">Plate IV.</a> represents a man dressed to personate Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni, or Slayer of the Alien Gods,
as he appears in an act of succor in the ceremony of the night chant, on the afternoon
of the ninth day, in company with two other masqueraders (<i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni<a href="#not270" class="noteref">270</a> and <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>éol<i>t</i>oi<a href="#not206" class="noteref">206</a>). The personator has his body painted black with charcoal of four sacred plants,
and his hands painted white. He wears a black mask which has a fringe of yellow or
reddish hair across the crown and an ornament of turkey&#x2019;s and eagle&#x2019;s feathers on
top. Five parallel lines with five angles in each, to represent lightning, are painted
on one cheek of the mask (sometimes the right, sometimes the left). Small, diamond-shaped
holes are cut in the mask for eyes and mouth, and to the edge of each hole a small
white shell is attached. On his body there are drawn in white clay the figures of
eight bows; six are drawn as shown in the picture and two more are drawn over the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>shoulder-blades. All these bows are shown as complete (or strung) except those on
the left leg and left side of the back, which are represented open or unstrung, as
shown in the plate and <a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>. The symbol at the left leg is made first, that on the left shoulder last of all.
All the component lines of the symbol are drawn from above downward; <a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a> shows the order in which they must be drawn. The symbols must all turn in one direction.
The personator wears a collar of fox-skin, a number of rich necklaces of shell, turquoise
and coral, a fine skirt or sash around his loins (usually scarlet baize, <i lang="es">bayeta</i>, but velvet or any rich material will do), a belt decorated with silver, and ordinary
moccasins. He carries in his right hand a great stone knife, with which, in the scene
of succor, he makes motions at the patient and at the medicine-lodge to draw out the
disease. The patient prays to him, and gives him a cigarette painted black and decorated
with the bow-symbols in white. This cigarette is preferably deposited under a piñon-tree.
A dry-painting of this god has never been seen by the author, and he has been told
that none is ever made.

<p id="not270"><span class="parNum">270.</span> <a href="#plate7">Plate VII.</a> represents the personator of the War God, <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni, or Child of the Water, as he appears in the act of succor described in notes
206 and 269. His body and limbs are painted with a native red ochre; his hands are
smeared with white earth; and eight symbols are drawn in his body in white,&#x2014;two on
the chest, two on the arms, two on the legs, and two on the back, partly over the
shoulder-blades. As with the bow-symbols of Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni (note <a href="#not269">269</a>), two of the symbols are left open or unfinished,&#x2014;that on the left leg (painted first)
and that over the left shoulder-blade (painted last), to indicate (some say) that
the labors of the god are not yet done. <a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a> shows the order and direction in which each component line of the symbol must be
drawn. The symbols represent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>a queue, such as the Navahoes now wear (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>). Some say these figures represent the queue of the god&#x2019;s mother, others say they
represent the scalps of conquered enemies; the latter is a more probable explanation.
The personator wears a mask painted also with red ochre (all except a small triangular
space over the face, which is colored black and bordered with white); and it is decorated
both in front and behind with a number of queue-symbols (the number is never the same
in two masks, but is always a multiple of four). The mask has a fringe of red or yellow
hair, and a cockade of turkey-tail and a downy eagle-feather. The holes for the eyes
and mouth are diamond-shaped, and have white shells attached to them. The actor carries
in his left hand a small round cylinder of cedar-wood painted red, and in his right
a cylinder of piñon painted black. With these, in the scene of succor, he makes motions
at the patient and at the lodge. Like his companion, the personator of Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni,
he wears a collar of fox-skin (<i lang="la">Vulpes velox</i>); rich necklaces of shell, turquoise, and coral; a skirt or sash of <i lang="es">bayeta</i>, or some other rich material; a belt adorned with plaques of silver; and ordinary
moccasins. The sacrificial cigarette which he receives is painted red, marked with
the queue-symbols, and deposited under a cedar-tree. No dry-painting of <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni has been seen by the author, and he has been assured that none is made.
</p>
<p id="not271"><span class="parNum">271.</span> The name <i>H</i>as-t<i>s</i>é<i>l</i>-t<i>s</i>i (Red God) is derived from <i>H</i>ast<i>s</i>é (God, see <a href="#par78">par. 78</a>) and <i>l</i>&#x12d;t<i>s</i>í (red). The Red God, it is said, is never depicted in dry-paintings. The author has
never seen the character in masquerade; it seldom appears,&#x2014;only on the rare occasions
when there is no dance of the naak<i>h</i>aí on the last night of the night chant. He seems to be a god of racing. The following
account of him is from verbal description: Red God is one of the yéi, and dwells wherever
other yéi dwell (hence there are many). His representative never appears in an act
of succor and never helps the patient. A fast runner is chosen to play the part. He
goes round among the assembled Indians and challenges men, by signs and inarticulate
cries, to race with him. If he wins, he whips the loser with two wands of yucca leaves
(culled with special observances) which he carries. If he loses, the winner must not
whip him. If the loser begs him to whip softly he whips hard, and <i>vice versa</i>. His body is painted red and has queue-symbols drawn on it, like those of <i>T</i>o&#x2bb;bad<i>z</i>&#x12d;st<i>s</i>íni (<a href="#plate7">plate VII.</a>). His mask, which is a domino and not a cap, is painted red and marked with circles
and curves in white. His cigarette is prepared on the fourth day, but it is not given
to him to sacrifice; it is placed by other hands. Song and prayer accompany the preparation
and sacrifice of the cigarette. The latter is painted red, and decorated in white
with queue-symbols, either two or four; if four, two are closed or complete, and two
open or incomplete. (Note <a href="#not270">270</a>.)

<p class="first">BY PROF. JOHN COMFORT FILLMORE.
</p>
<p id="not272"><span class="parNum">272.</span> The twenty-eight songs which I have transcribed from phonographic records made by
Dr. Washington Matthews have very great scientific interest and value, inasmuch as
they throw much light on the problem of the form spontaneously assumed by natural
folk-songs. Primitive man, expressing his emotions, especially strongly excited feeling,
in song, without any rules or theories, must, of course, move spontaneously along
the lines of least resistance. This is the law under which folk-melodies must necessarily
be shaped. The farther back we can get toward absolutely primitive expression of emotion
in song, the more valuable is our material for scientific purposes; because we can
be certain that it is both spontaneous and original, unaffected by contact with civilized
music and by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>any and all theories. In such music we may study the operation of natural psychical
laws correlated with physical laws, working freely and coming to spontaneous expression
through the vocal apparatus.
</p>
<p>These Navaho songs are especially valuable because they carry us well back toward
the beginnings of music-making. One only needs to hear them sung, or listen to them
in the admirable phonographic records of Dr. Matthews, to be convinced of this from
the very quality of tone in which they are sung. In all of them the sounds resemble
howling more than singing, yet they are unmistakably musical in two very important
particulars: (1) In their strongly marked rhythm; (2) In the unquestionably harmonic
relations of the successive tones. I shall deal with them, therefore, under the two
heads of <span class="sc">Rhythm</span> and <span class="sc">Harmonic Melody</span>.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum">1.</span> <span class="sc">Rhythm.</span>&#x2014;Mr. Richard Wallascheck, the distinguished author of &#x201c;Primitive Music,&#x201d; has lately
called attention to the importance of sonant rhythm. Not only does the rhythmic impulse
precede the other musical elements, but the superiority of sonant rhythm is such as
to serve as an incitement to tone-production. Rhythm tends to set the voice going;
and of course vocal sounds, which constitute the first music, do not become music
until they are rhythmically ordered. They tend to become so ordered by a natural law
of pulsation which need not be discussed here. The regularly recurring pulsations,
which specially show themselves in all prolonged emissions of vocal sounds, tend also
to form themselves in metrical groups; speaking broadly, these metrical groups are
usually twos or threes, or simple multiples of twos or threes. This is so, for the
most part, in savage folk-music, in our most advanced culture-music, and in all the
development which comes between. The metrical grouping into fives or sevens is comparatively
rare; but I have found it more frequently by far in savage folk-music than in our
music of civilization.
</p>
<p>The most striking characteristic of the metrical grouping of tones in the Navaho songs
here given is the freedom with which the singer changes from one elementary metre
to the other; <i>i.e.</i> from twos to threes and <i>vice versa</i>. So in the compound metres: two twos and three twos, or two threes and three threes,
are intermingled with the utmost freedom, so that few of them can be marked in the
notation with a single-time signature. Or, if they are, there is almost sure to be
an exceptional measure or two here and there which varies from the fundamental metrical
type. Thus, the first song on cylinder No. 38 has metrical groupings of three threes
and of two threes; <i>i.e.</i> <span class="musictime"><span class="top">9</span><span class="bottom">8</span></span> and <span class="musictime"><span class="top">6</span><span class="bottom">8</span></span> time. The two songs on cylinder No. 41 have three twos and two twos, treating the
eighth note as a unit; or, better, <span class="musictime"><span class="top">2</span><span class="bottom">4</span></span> and <span class="musictime"><span class="top">3</span><span class="bottom">4</span></span> metre, mingled at the pleasure of the singer. Nearly all the songs vary the metre
in this way. The one on cylinder No. 62 has an exceptionally rich variety of metrical
arrangement; while the second one, on cylinder No. 38, is exceptionally simple and
monotonous in metre and rhythm. A few of them, like No. 25, recorded on cylinder No.
143, are singularly irregular. This song would seem to be based on a grouping of simple
twos (<span class="musictime"><span class="top">2</span><span class="bottom">4</span></span> time, equal to <span class="musictime"><span class="top">4</span><span class="bottom">8</span></span>) as its fundamental metrical conception; yet a great many measures contain only three
eighth notes, and some contain five or even six. The song numbered 28, on cylinder
No. 144, has a <span class="musictime"><span class="top">8</span><span class="bottom">8</span></span> metre as its foundation, but varied by <span class="musictime"><span class="top">2</span><span class="bottom">4</span></span>, equal to <span class="musictime"><span class="top">4</span><span class="bottom">8</span></span>. In respect of metrical grouping, these Navaho songs do not differ in any essential
characteristic from the songs of the Omahas, the Kwakiutls, the Pawnees, the Otoes,
the Sioux, and other aboriginal folk-music, nor from that of other nations and races,
including our own. The complexity of metrical arrangement has been carried much farther
by some other tribes, notably the Omahas and the Kwakiutls, than by the Navahoes,
so far as appears from the present collection of songs. There is no record here of
an accompanying drum-beat, so that, if the combinations of dissimilar rhythms which
are so common in the two above-named tribes exist among the Navahoes, they are yet
to be recorded and transcribed.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum">2.</span> <span class="sc">Harmonic Melody.</span>&#x2014;These songs seem to be a real connecting link between excited shouting and excited
singing. In <i>quality</i> of tone they are shouts or howls. In <i>pitch-relations</i> they are <i>unmistakably harmonic</i>. Some of them manifest this characteristic most strikingly. For example, the two
songs on cylinder No. 41 contain <i>all</i> the tones which compose the chord of C major, <i>and no others</i>. The second one on cylinder No. 38 has the tones D and F sharp and no others, except
in the little preliminary flourish at the beginning, and here there is only a passing
E, which fills up the gap between the two chord-tones. D is evidently the key-note,
and the whole melody is made up of the Tonic chord incomplete. The first song on the
same cylinder is similarly made up of the incomplete Tonic chord in C minor; only
the opening phrase has the incomplete chord of E flat, the relative major. Cylinder
No. 49 has nothing but the Tonic chord in C major, and the chord is complete. No.
61 has the complete chord of B flat minor and nothing else. No. 62 is made up mainly
of the chord of F major complete. It has two by-tones occasionally used, G and D,
the former belonging to the Dominant and the other to both the Sub-dominant and Relative
minor chords. Song No. 9 on cylinder No. 100 has the incomplete chord of D sharp minor,
with G sharp, the Sub-dominant in the key, as an occasional by-tone. The last tone
of each period, the lowest tone of the song, sounds in the phonograph as if the singer
could not reach it easily, and the pitch is rather uncertain. It was probably meant
for G sharp; but a personal interview with the singer would be necessary to settle
the point conclusively. Song No. 10, on the same cylinder, has the complete Tonic
chord in D sharp minor and nothing else except the tone C sharp, which is here <i>not</i> a melodic by-tone, but a <i>harmonic tone</i>, <i>a minor seventh added to the Tonic chord</i>. This is curiously analogous to some of the melodies I heard in the Dahomey village
at the World&#x2019;s Fair, and also to some of the melodies of our own Southern negroes.
Song No. 11, on the same cylinder, has the same characteristics as No. 9. Nos. 12
and 13, on cylinder No. 135, contain the complete chord of D flat and nothing else.
The two songs on cylinder No. 138 contain the complete chord of C major and nothing
else, except at the beginning, where A, the relative minor tone, comes in, in the
opening phrase. As a rule, whatever by-tones there are in these songs are used in
the preliminary phrase or flourish of the song, and then the singer settles down steadily
to the line of the Tonic chord. The two songs recorded on No. 139 have the complete
major chord of B flat, with G, the relative minor, as a by-tone. The two songs on
No. 143 are in C sharp minor and embody the Tonic chord, with F sharp, the Sub-dominant,
as a by-tone. Only the first of the two begins with the tone B, which does not occur
again. Song No. 27, on cylinder No. 144, embodies only the complete chord of C sharp
minor. No. 28 has the same chord, with F sharp as a by-tone. The two songs on No.
145 are in D minor and are made up mainly of the Tonic chord. The by-tones used are
G and B flat, which make up two thirds of the Sub-dominant chord, and C, which belongs
to the relative major. No. 32, on cylinder No. 146, has more of diatonic melody. It
is in G major, and embodies the chord of the Tonic with by-tones belonging to both
the Dominant and Sub-dominant chords, one from each chord. No. 33, on the same cylinder,
is less melodious, but has the same harmonic elements. Cylinder 147 has two songs
in D major which embody the Tonic chord complete, with slight use of a single by-tone,
B, the relative minor. The same is true of song No. 36, on cylinder No. 148. Song
No. 37, on the same cylinder, has the major chord of C and nothing else.
</p>
<p>There are two striking facts in all this: (1) When these Navahoes make music spontaneously,&#x2014;make
<i>melodies</i> by singing tones in rhythmically ordered succession,&#x2014;there is always a tone which
forces itself on our consciousness as a key-note, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>or Tonic, and this tone, together with the tones which make up its chord (whether
major or minor), invariably predominates overwhelmingly; (2) Whenever by-tones are
employed, they invariably belong to the chords which stand in the nearest relation
to the Tonic.
</p>
<p>I do not care at present to go into any speculations as to why this is so. No matter
now what may be the influence of sonant rhythm; what may be the relations of the psychical,
physiological, and physical elements; how sound is related to music; how men come
to the conception of a minor Tonic when only the major chord is given in the physical
constitution of tone. All these questions I wish to waive at this time and only to
insist on this one fact, viz.: That, so far as these Navaho songs are concerned, <i>the line of least resistance is always a harmonic line</i>. If we find the same true of all other folk-melodies, I can see no possible escape
from the conclusion that <i>harmonic perception is the formative principle in folk-melody</i>. This perception may be sub-conscious, if you please; the savage never heard a chord
sung or played as a simultaneous combination of tones in his life; he has no notion
whatever of the harmonic relations of tones. But it is not an accident that he sings,
or shouts, or howls, straight along the line of a chord, and never departs from it
except now and then to touch on some of the nearest related chord-tones, using them
mainly as passing-tones to fill up the gap between the tones of his Tonic chord. Such
things do not happen by accident, but by law.
</p>
<p>That these Navahoes do precisely this thing, no listener can doubt who knows a chord
when he hears it. But the same thing is true of all the folk-music I have ever studied.
Hundreds of Omaha, Kwakiutl, Otoe, Pawnee, Sioux, Winnebago, Iroquois, Mexican Indian,
Zuñi, Australian, African, Malay, Chinese, Japanese, Hindoo, Arab, Turkish, and European
folk-songs which I have carefully studied, taking down many of them from the lips
of the native singers, all tell the same story. They are all built on simple harmonic
lines, all imply harmony, are all equally intelligible to peoples the most diverse
in race, and consequently owe their origin and shaping to the same underlying formative
principles.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wallascheck has called attention to the fact that the rhythmic impulse precedes
the musical tones, and also to the part played by sonant rhythm in setting tone-production
going. The rhythmic impulse is doubtless the fundamental one in the <i>origination</i> of music. But when the tone-production is once started by the rhythmic impulse, <i>it takes a direction in accordance with the laws of harmonic perception</i>. I was long ago forced to this conclusion in my study of the Omaha music; and these
Navaho songs furnish the most striking corroboration of it. How else can we possibly
account for the fact that so many of these songs contain absolutely nothing but chord
tones? How can we escape the conclusion that the line of least resistance is a harmonic
line? Is it not plain that, in the light of this principle, every phenomenon of folk-music
becomes clear and intelligible? Is there any other hypothesis which will account for
the most striking characteristics of folk-music? Every student must answer these questions
for himself. But I, for my part, am wholly unable to resist the conviction that <i>the harmonic sense is the shaping, formative principle in folk-melody</i>.

<p>[In the numbers of <i>The Land of Sunshine</i> (Los Angeles, Cal.), for October and November, 1896, under the title of &#x201c;Songs of
the Navajos,&#x201d; the poetry and music of this tribe have already been discussed by Professor
Fillmore and the author. All the music which follows (see pp. 258, 279&#x2013;290), except
that of the &#x201c;Dove Song,&#x201d; was written by Professor Fillmore.]

<p class="first">In endeavoring to explain the meaning of this song, the singer related that Nayén&#x115;zga&#x323;ni
said to his mother, &#x201c;You are the divine one, not I.&#x201d; She replied, &#x201c;No, you are the
divine one.&#x201d; They were exchanging compliments. Then he said, &#x201c;Not for my sake, but
for yours, were these treasures (weapons, etc.) given by the Sun. They are yours.&#x201d;
For the meaning of b&#x12d;<i>z</i>á (his treasure), see <a href="#not246">note 246</a>. Ni<i>z</i>á or n&#x12d;&#x2032;<i>z</i>a means your treasure; the last syllable is here repeated perhaps as a poetic plural.
The houses of knives are said to be the different chambers in the house of the Sun.
Meaningless syllables are omitted in this text.

<p>Alíl or alíli means a show, dance, or other single exhibition of the rites (see <a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>). It also means a wand or other sacred implement used in the rites. It is thought
that the colored hoops for raising a storm, described in <a href="#par355">par. 355</a>, are the alíli referred to in this song.

<p>The expressions Sá<i>n</i>a nagái and B&#x12d;ké <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni appear in many songs and prayers, and are always thus united. Their literal translation
is as given above; but they are equivalent to saying, &#x201c;Long life and happiness;&#x201d; as
part of a prayer, they are a supplication for a long and happy life. <i>H</i>o<i>z</i>óni means, primarily, terrestrially beautiful; but it means also happy, happily, or,
in a certain sense, good.
</p>
<p>Estsánatlehi is often called, in song, Estsánatle<i>s</i>i, and T<i>s</i>óhanoai is often called (apparently with greater propriety) T<i>s</i>í<i>n</i>hanoai. <i>S</i>&#x12d;ní&#x2bb; = <i>S</i>&#x12d;&#x2032;ni.

<h4 class="main">REMARKS ON THE PRAYER.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This prayer is addressed to a mythic thunder-bird, hence the reference to wings; but
the bird is spoken of as a male divinity, and is supposed to dwell with other yéi
at Tse&#x2bb;gíhi. The prayer is said at the beginning of work, on the last night of the
kléd<i>z</i>i <i>h</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>. The shaman speaks it, verse by verse, as it is here recorded, and one of the atsá&#x2bb;<i>l</i>ei or first dancers, repeats it, verse by verse, after him.
</p>
<p>The word <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>ó means, primarily, terrestrial beauty. Its derivative <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>ógo means in a beautiful earthly manner. <i>H</i>o<i>z</i>óni means beautiful on the earth, locally beautiful (&#x12d;n<i>z</i>óni refers to the beauty of objects and persons); <i>H</i>o<i>z</i>óna signifies <i>again</i> beautiful. But the meanings of these words, and others of similar derivation, have
been extended to mean happy, happiness, in a happy or joyful manner, etc. In a free
translation they must be rendered by various English words.
</p>
<p>The four final verses have been previously recorded by the author as <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni <i>h</i>aslé (Qojòni qaslè), but he now regards the form <i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óna <i>h</i>astlé as more correct.<a href="#not289" class="noteref">289</a> This expression, repeated twice or four times, according to circumstances, ends all
Navaho prayers, yet recorded. It is analogous to the Christian Amen.
</p>
<p id="not289"><span class="parNum">289.</span> In a few instances, in this work, a Navaho word may be found spelled or accentuated
with slight differences in different places. It must not be inferred from this that
one form is correct and the other not. As usage varies in the languages of the most
cultured races, so does it vary (only in greater degree) in the languages of the unlettered.
A word was often heard differently pronounced and was therefore differently recorded
by the author. An effort has been made to decide on a single standard of form and
always to give preference to this; but, in a few cases, variations may have been overlooked.
Words sometimes undergo great changes when they become parts of compound words. Where
the form of a word in this work varies from that presented in previous works by the
author the variation may be accounted for, in some cases by the difference in the
alphabets used, and in others by the changes of opinion which have come to him in
time, as the result of a more extended experience or a more advanced study of the
language.

<h3 class="main">Encoding</h3>
<p class="first">The orthography used in this book for Navajo differs significantly from the orthography
currently in use. No attempt has been made to change this, but obvious inconsistencies
have been corrected.
</p>
<p>For convenient processing, the italic letters used in the orthography of Navajo have
been encoded in Unicode as letters with macrons below. For derived files this encoding
will be converted back to italic unadorned letters.
